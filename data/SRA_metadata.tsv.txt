SRD-A1-LFH-2	9_S9	r-DNA seq of soil microbiome from forest soil amended with wood ash	AMPLICON	METATRANSCRIPTOMIC	PCR	paired	ILLUMINA	Illumina MiSeq	"All soil samples were collected in June or July 2017 Due to logistical constraints, aside from ETM, HLB and ILK where two replicates were sampled from each block, one sample was collected from Each block within each site that was sampled. The fresh litter-moss layer (L), the Fermented-Humic (FH horizons) and upper mineral soil (MIN, 0-10 cm) were sampled separately. When L and FH layers could not be effectively separated during sampling, a pooled sample was taken (LFH). Litter-moss and FH components were sampled from a 15 x 15 cm frame, after which mineral soil was collected in a bleached 5cm diameter PVC pipe to a depth of 20cm. All sampling was completed with gloves to reduce cross-contamination. Samples were immediately frozen at -20?C  after sampling and held at that temperature until analysis. All samples were shipped to the Great Lakes Forestry Centre (Sault Ste. Marie) where soils were homogenized, and subsamples were aseptically taken for enzyme and barcoding analyses.
