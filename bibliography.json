		"abstract": "The lipid composition of microbial communities can indicate their response to changes in the surrounding environment induced by anthropogenic practices, chemical contamination or climatic conditions. A considerable number of analytical techniques exist for the examination of microbial lipids. This article reviews a selection of methods available for environmental samples as applied for lipid extraction, fractionation, derivatization and quantiﬁcation. The discussion focuses on the origin of the standard methods, the different modiﬁed versions developed for investigation of microbial lipids, as well as the advantages and limitations of each. Current modiﬁcations to standard methods show a number of improvements for each of the different steps associated with analysis. The advantages and disadvantages of lipid analysis compared to other popular techniques are clariﬁed. Accordingly, the preferential utilization of signature lipid biomarker analysis in current research is considered. It is clear from recent literature that this technique stays relevant – mainly for the variety of microbial properties that can be determined in a single analysis.",

The present study showed that the predominant fatty acid was 15:0i followed by 15:0a, which were characteristic of Bacillus. The results suggest that the order of decreasing abundance of terminally branched fatty acids is as follows: iso even-numbered acids namely 16:0i, 14:0i, iso odd-numbered acids, 15:0i, 17:0i, 13:0i, 19:0i and anteiso acids, 15:0a, 17:0a, 11:0a, 19:0a. Straight chain saturated fatty acids identified were 10:0, 12:0, 14:0, 16:0, 18:0. The remaining fatty acids components were present in negligible quantities. The isolates were also identified and classified using the comparison with the TSBA database as B. cereus-GC subgroup A (isolates ASR 29CIII, ASR 37CIII), B. subtilis (isolates ASR 6SII, ASR 21SI, ASR 25SV), B. laevolacticus (isolates ASR 4LIII, ASR 7SIII, ASR 11LVI, ASR 42SVII), B. alcalophilus (isolates ASR 14PI, ASR 18PIV), B. pumilus subgroup A (isolate- ASR 41PVIII), Staphylococcus schleiferi (isolates- ASR 2LII, ASR 5LIV), S. gallinarum-GC subgroup A (isolates ASR 13SIV, ASR 33SVI), Kurthia sibirica (isolate ASR 15PII), Geobacillus stearothermophilus-GC subgroup (isolate ASR 8LV).",

Total lipids were extracted from oleaginous yeast (Rhodotorula glutinis) using pressurized liquid extraction (PLE). The effects of extraction parameters on lipid extraction yield were studied by employing a second-order central composite design. The optimal condition was obtained as three cycles of 15min at 100°C with a ratio of 144g of hydromatrix per 100g of dry cell weight. Different analysis methods were used to compare the optimized PLE method with two conventional methods (Soxhlet and modification of Bligh and Dyer methods) under efficiency, selectivity and reproducibility criteria thanks to gravimetric analysis, GC with flame ionization detector, High Performance Liquid Chromatography linked to Evaporative Light Scattering Detector (HPLC-ELSD) and thin-layer chromatographic analysis. For each sample, the lipid extraction yield with optimized PLE was higher than those obtained with referenced methods (Soxhlet and Bligh and Dyer methods with, respectively, a recovery of 78% and 85% compared to PLE method). Moreover, the use of PLE led to major advantages such as an analysis time reduction by a factor of 10 and solvent quantity reduction by 70%, compared with traditional extraction methods.",

		"abstract": "Microbial communities are important drivers and regulators of ecosystem processes. To understand how management of ecosystems may affect microbial communities, a relatively precise but effort-intensive technique to assay microbial community composition is phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis. PLFA was developed to analyze phospholipid biomarkers, which can be used as indicators of microbial biomass and the composition of broad functional groups of fungi and bacteria. It has commonly been used to compare soils under alternative plant communities, ecology, and management regimes. The PLFA method has been shown to be sensitive to detecting shifts in microbial community composition. An alternative method, fatty acid methyl ester extraction and analysis (MIDI-FA) was developed for rapid extraction of total lipids, without separation of the phospholipid fraction, from pure cultures as a microbial identification technique. This method is rapid but is less suited for soil samples because it lacks an initial step separating soil particles and begins instead with a saponification reaction that likely produces artifacts from the background organic matter in the soil. This article describes a method that increases throughput while balancing effort and accuracy for extraction of lipids from the cell membranes of microorganisms for use in characterizing both total lipids and the relative abundance of indicator lipids to determine soil microbial community structure in studies with many samples. The method combines the accuracy achieved through PLFA profiling by extracting and concentrating soil lipids as a first step, and a reduction in effort by saponifying the organic material extracted and processing with the MIDI-FA method as a second step.",

Two organic layers (moss and F1) as well as two mineral soil horizons (EA and C1) were sampled and extracted with DCM/MeOH (93:7 v/v) by ASE at 75 °C and a pressure of 6.9 · 10 6 Pa or 17 · 10 6 Pa. Soxhlet extractions were used as the established reference method. After clean-up and derivatization with BSTFA, the extracts were analyzed on GC/MS. Using Soxhlet as a reference, we found ASE to extract all compounds adequately. The n-alkanes, especially, were found to be extracted very efficiently from all horizons studied. Only the n-fatty acids and b-sitosterol from the organic layers seemed to be extracted at a slightly lower efficiency by ASE. In all but two instances the relative abundance of extracted lipids within a component class was the same regardless of the extraction method used. Using a higher pressure in the ASE extractions significantly increased the extraction efficiency for all component classes in the moss layer, except b-sitosterol. The effect was most pronounced for the n-alkanes. In the EA horizon, a higher pres-sure slightly reduced the extraction efficiency for dehydroabietic acid. The observed differences between ASE and Soxhlet extractions as well as the pressure effect can be explained by a decrease in polarity of the extractant due to the elevated pressure and temperature applied during ASE extractions as compared to Soxhlet extractions. This would mainly increase the extraction efficiency of the least polar biomarkers: the n-alkanes as was observed. In addition, a better penetration of still partially water-filled micro pores under elevated pressure and temperature may have played a role.",

		"abstract": "Analysis of soil lipids may contribute to an improved understanding of atmosphere to soil carbon fluxes, soil organic matter source differentiation and pollutant accumulation. Soil lipids, mostly originating from plants and microorganisms, have traditionally been analysed by non-automated extraction and separation methods, which produce several lipid fractions, operationally defined by polarity. Here we present a combination of fast, automated and reproducible techniques, adopted from organic geochemical studies, for preparative separation of individual soil lipid fractions with increasing polarity. These techniques involve commercially available instruments, including accelerated solvent extraction and a two-step automated medium-pressure liquid chromatography procedure. The method yields eight lipid fractions consisting of five fractions fully amenable to gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) (aliphatic hydrocarbons, aromatic hydrocarbons, ketones, alcohols, carboxylic acids), and three fractions of highly polar or high molecular weight compounds (bases, very long-chain wax esters (C40+), high polarity compounds) that were not measurable with GC/MS under standard conditions. We tested the method on five agricultural soils. Results show that (i) mass recoveries for the individual fractions are reproducible, (ii) within individual fractions compound distribution patterns are reproducible, as demonstrated for alkanes and carboxylic acids, and (iii) individual fractions represent distinct and clean compound classes, free of interfering substances detectable by GC/MS. Thus, automated separation can be a fast, effective and reproducible procedure for fractionation of complex mixtures of soil lipids into clean compound classes, directly suitable for a variety of molecular (e.g. GC/MS) and isotopic characterizations (e.g. gas chromatography coupled with isotope ratio monitoring mass spectrometry or accelerator mass spectrometry).",

The hydrophobic nature of such compounds may increase their stabilization potential. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the potential of aliphatic compounds in mineral soil horizons along a Dystric Cambisol profile under beech forest to increase hydrophobicity. The conceptual approach included the analyses of soil samples before and after solvent extraction and base hydrolysis for elemental and isotopic composition. Additionally, the advancing contact angle was measured to quantify hydrophobicity. Curie-point pyrolysis GC/MS was carried out to characterize the nature of alkyl C present in subsoil samples. A close correlation between the 14C activity and the stable-C-isotope ratio (δ13C) indicates isotopic fractionation upon C stabilization in subsoils. Free lipids contributed less than 10% to the organic C found in subsoil horizons. Base hydrolysis revealed very high amounts of hydroxyalkanoic acids in the B horizons of the acid forest soil. Hydrophobicity of SOM was not found to be correlated to esterified- or free-lipid content. The contact angle was in a similar range for all bulk soil horizons, suggesting greater hydrophobicity of organic matter in subsoil horizons considering their very low concentrations of organic C compared to the A horizon. The quantity and nature of pyrolysis products change with increasing depth in the soil profile. Aliphatic products cannot be detected in B and C horizons by Curie-point pyrolysis GC/MS.",

		"abstract": "Abstract. Microphytobenthos and benthic macroalgae play an important role in system metabolism within shallow coastal bays. However, their independent and interactive influences on sediment organic matter (SOM) are not well understood. We investigated the influence of macroalgae and microphytobenthos on SOM quantity and quality in an experimental mesocosm system using bulk and molecular level (total hydrolyzable amino acids, THAA; phospholipid linked fatty acids, PLFA; pigment) analyses. Our experiment used an incomplete factorial design made up of two factors, each with two levels: (1) light (ambient vs. dark) and (2) macroalgae (presence vs. absence of live macroalgae). Over the course of the 42-day experiment, total organic carbon (TOC) and total nitrogen (TN) increased under ambient light by 173 ± 14 and 141 ± 7%, respectively, compared to in the dark (78 ± 29 and 39 ± 22%). THAA comprised a substantial fraction of SOM (~ 16% of TOC, 35% of TN) and followed TOC and TN accumulation patterns. Mole percent composition of the THAA pool indicated that SOM was composed of more labile organic material (e.g., L-glutamic acid, phenylalanine) under ambient light conditions while SOM in dark treatments was more degraded, with higher proportions of glycine and D-alanine. PLFA content, which represents viable biomass, made up ~ 1% of TOC and contained high levels of algal fatty acids in the light, particularly PLFA derived from diatoms. In the presence of microphytobenthos (i.e., light and macroalgae treatments), SOM lability increased, resulting in the observed increases in bacterial PLFA concentrations. Macroalgae, which were added to half of the light treatments, decreased SOM accumulation compared to light treatments without macroalgae, with TOC and TN increasing by only 130 ± 32 and 94 ± 24%, respectively. This decrease likely resulted from shading by macroalgae, which reduced production of microphytobenthos. The presence of macroalgae decreased SOM lability as well, which resulted in diminished buildup of bacterial biomass. By the final day of the experiment, principal component analysis revealed that sediment composition in treatments with macroalgae was more similar to dark treatments and less similar to light treatments without macroalgae. Overall, microphytobenthos and benthic macroalgae fundamentally altered SOM quality and quantity, which may have notable ecological consequences for shallow-water systems such as increased hypoxia/anoxia, sulfide accumulation, enhanced mineralization and/or stimulated denitrification.",

		"abstract": "The extraction and transesterification of soil lipids into fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) is a useful technique for studying soil microbial communities. The objective of this study was to find the best solvent mixture to extract soil lipids with a pressurized solvent extractor system. Four solvent mixtures were selected for testing: chloroform:methanol:phosphate buffer (1:2:0.8, v/v/v), chloroform:methanol (1:2, v/v), hexane:2-propanol (3:2, v/v) and acetone. Soils were from agricultural fields and had a wide range of clay, organic matter and microbial biomass contents. Total lipid fatty acid methyl esters (TL-FAMEs) were the extractable soil lipids identified and quantified with gas chromatography and flame ionization detection. Concentrations of TL-FAMEs ranged from 57.3 to 542.2nmoleg−1 soil (dry weight basis). The highest concentrations of TL-FAMEs were extracted with chloroform:methanol:buffer or chloroform:methanol mixtures than with the hexane:2-propanol or acetone solvents. The concentrations of TL-FAMEs in chemical groups, including saturated, branched, mono- and poly-unsaturated and hydroxy fatty acids were assessed, and biological groups (soil bacteria, mycorrhizal fungi, saprophytic fungi and higher plants) was distinguished. The extraction efficiency for the chemical and biological groups followed the general trend of: chloroform:methanol:buffer≥chloroform:methanol>hexane:2-propanol=acetone. Discriminant analysis revealed differences in TL-FAME profiles based on the solvent mixture and the soil type. Although solvent mixtures containing chloroform and methanol were the most efficient for extracting lipids from the agricultural soils in this study, soil properties and the lipid groups to be studied should be considered when selecting a solvent mixture. According to our knowledge, this is the first report of soil lipid extraction with hexane:2-propanol or acetone in a pressurized solvent extraction system.",

		"abstract": "Soil and rhizosphere microbial communities in agroecosystems may be affected by soil, climate, plant species, and management. The management and environmental factors controlling microbial biomass and community structure were identified in a three-year field experiment. The experiment consisted of a tomato production agroecosystem with the following nine treatments: bare soil, black polyethylene mulch, white polyethylene mulch, vetch cover crop, vetch roots only, vetch shoots only, rye cover crop, rye roots only, and rye shoots only. The following hypotheses were tested: (1) Temperature and moisture differences between polyethylene-covered and cover-cropped treatments are partly responsible for treatment effects on soil microbial community composition, and (2) Different species of cover crops have unique root and shoot effects on soil microbial community composition. Microbial biomass and community composition were measured by phospholipid fatty acid analysis. Microbial biomass was increased by all cover crop treatments, including root only and shoot only. Cover cropping increased the absolute amount of all microbial groups, but Gram-positive bacteria decreased in proportion under cover crops. We attribute this decrease to increased readily available carbon under cover-cropped treatments, which favored other groups over Gram-positive bacteria. Higher soil temperatures under certain treatments also increased the proportion of Gram-positive bacteria. Vetch shoots increased the amount and proportion of Gram-negative bacteria, fungi, and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in the rhizosphere of tomato plants. The imposed treatments were much more significant than soil temperature, moisture, pH, and texture in controlling microbial biomass and community structure.",

		"abstract": "Native North American prairie grasslands are renowned for the richness of their soils, having excellent soil structure and very high organic content and microbial biomass. In this study, surface soils from three prairie restorations of varying ages and plant community compositions were compared with a nearby undisturbed native prairie remnant and a cropped agricultural field in terms of soil physical, chemical and microbial properties. Soil moisture, organic matter, total carbon, total nitrogen, total sulfur, C:N, water-holding capacity and microbial biomass (total PLFA) were significantly greater (p<0.05) in the virgin prairie remnant as well as the two long-term (21 and 24 year) prairie restorations, compared with the agricultural field and the restoration that was begun more recently (7 years prior to sampling). Soil bulk density was significantly greater (p<0.05) in the agricultural and recently restored sites. In most cases, the soil quality indicators and microbial community structures in the restoration sites were intermediate between those of the virgin prairie and the agricultural sites. Levels of poly-β-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) and PLFA indicators of nutritional stress were significantly greater (p<0.05) in the agricultural and recent restoration sites than in the long-term restorations or the native prairie. Samples could be assigned to the correct site by discriminant analysis of the PLFA data, with the exception that the two long-term restoration sites overlapped. Redundancy analysis showed that prairie age (p<0.005) was the most important environmental factor in determining the PLFA microbial community composition, with C:N (p<0.015) also being significant. These findings demonstrate that prairie restorations can lead to improved quality of surface soils. We predict that the conversion of farmland into prairie will shift the soil quality, microbial community biomass and microbial community composition in the direction of native prairies, but with the restoration methods tested it may take many decades to approach the levels found in a virgin prairie throughout the soil profile.",

A cornerstone of NGS is the quantification of RNA or DNA presence as counts. However, these counts are not counts per se: their magnitude is determined arbitrarily by the sequencing depth, not by the input material. Consequently, counts must undergo normalization prior to use. Conventional normalization methods require a set of assumptions: they assume that the majority of features are unchanged and that all environments under study have the same carrying capacity for nucleotide synthesis. These assumptions are often untestable and may not hold when heterogeneous samples are compared.\n\nResults\nMethods developed within the field of compositional data analysis offer a general solution that is assumption-free and valid for all data. Herein, we synthesize the extant literature to provide a concise guide on how to apply compositional data analysis to NGS count data.\n\nConclusions\nIn highlighting the limitations of total library size, effective library size, and spike-in normalizations, we propose the log-ratio transformation as a general solution to answer the question, “Relative to some important activity of the cell, what is changing?”",

		"abstract": "Though variable selection is one of the most relevant tasks in microbiome analysis, e.g. for the identification of microbial signatures, many studies still rely on methods that ignore the compositional nature of microbiome data. The applicability of compositional data analysis methods has been hampered by the availability of software and the difficulty in interpreting their results. This work is focused on three methods for variable selection that acknowledge the compositional structure of microbiome data: selbal, a forward selection approach for the identification of compositional balances, and clr-lasso and coda-lasso, two penalized regression models for compositional data analysis. This study highlights the link between these methods and brings out some limitations of the centered log-ratio transformation for variable selection. In particular, the fact that it is not subcompositionally consistent makes the microbial signatures obtained from clr-lasso not readily transferable. Coda-lasso is computationally efficient and suitable when the focus is the identification of the most associated microbial taxa. Selbal stands out when the goal is to obtain a parsimonious model with optimal prediction performance, but it is computationally greedy. We provide a reproducible vignette for the application of these methods that will enable researchers to fully leverage their potential in microbiome studies.",

These microbial signatures can be used for diagnosis, prognosis, or prediction of therapeutic response based on an individual’s specific microbiota., High-throughput sequencing technologies have revolutionized microbiome research by allowing the relative quantification of microbiome composition and function in different environments. In this work we focus on the identification of microbial signatures, groups of microbial taxa that are predictive of a phenotype of interest. We do this by acknowledging the compositional nature of the microbiome and the fact that it carries relative information. Thus, instead of defining a microbial signature as a linear combination in real space corresponding to the abundances of a group of taxa, we consider microbial signatures given by the geometric means of data from two groups of taxa whose relative abundances, or balance, are associated with the response variable of interest. In this work we present selbal, a greedy stepwise algorithm for selection of balances or microbial signatures that preserves the principles of compositional data analysis. We illustrate the algorithm with 16S rRNA abundance data from a Crohn’s microbiome study and an HIV microbiome study., IMPORTANCE We propose a new algorithm for the identification of microbial signatures.

		"abstract": "Wood ash amendment to forest soils contributes to the sustainability of the growing bioenergy industry, not only through decreased wood ash waste disposal in landfills but also by increasing soil/site productivity and tree growth. However, tree growth studies to date have reported variable responses to wood ash, highlighting the need to identify proper application rates under various soil/site conditions to maximize their benefits. We explored the influence of tree species, wood ash nutrient application rates, time since application, stand development stage, and initial (i.e., before wood ash application) soil pH and N on short‐term tree growth response to wood ash amendment across eight unique study sites spanning five Canadian Provinces. Jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb) had the most positive response to wood ash amendment compared to white (Picea glauca Moench), hybrid (Picea engelmannii x glauca Parry), and black spruce (Picea mariana Miller), where increasing nutrient application rates increased height growth response. In comparison, black spruce had the most negative response to wood ash amendment, where increasing nutrient application rates slightly decreased height growth response. Site as a random effect explained additional variation, highlighting the importance of other unidentified site characteristics. By examining trends in short‐term growth response across multiple studies with variable site characteristics, we found growth response differed by tree species and nutrient application rates, and that jack pine is a promising candidate for wood ash amendment. These results contribute to our knowledge of optimal wood ash amendment practices and environmentally sustainable bioenergy production.",

		"abstract": "Purpose\nThe ability to properly analyze and interpret large microbiome data sets has lagged behind our ability to acquire such data sets from environmental or clinical samples. Sequencing instruments impose a structure on these data: the natural sample space of a 16S rRNA gene sequencing data set is a simplex, which is a part of real space that is restricted to nonnegative values with a constant sum. Such data are compositional and should be analyzed using compositionally appropriate tools and approaches. However, most of the tools for 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis assume these data are unrestricted.\nMethods\nWe show that existing tools for compositional data (CoDa) analysis can be readily adapted to analyze high-throughput sequencing data sets.\nResults\nThe Human Microbiome Project tongue versus buccal mucosa data set shows how the CoDa approach can address the major elements of microbiome analysis. Reanalysis of a publicly available autism microbiome data set shows that the CoDa approach in concert with multiple hypothesis test corrections prevent false positive identifications.\nConclusions\nThe CoDa approach is readily scalable to microbiome-sized analyses. We provide example code and make recommendations to improve the analysis and reporting of microbiome data sets.",

		"abstract": "Experimental variance is a major challenge when dealing with high-throughput sequencing data. This variance has several sources: sampling replication, technical replication, variability within biological conditions, and variability between biological conditions. The high per-sample cost of RNA-Seq often precludes the large number of experiments needed to partition observed variance into these categories as per standard ANOVA models. We show that the partitioning of within-condition to between-condition variation cannot reasonably be ignored, whether in single-organism RNA-Seq or in Meta-RNA-Seq experiments, and further find that commonly-used RNA-Seq analysis tools, as described in the literature, do not enforce the constraint that the sum of relative expression levels must be one, and thus report expression levels that are systematically distorted. These two factors lead to misleading inferences if not properly accommodated. As it is usually only the biological between-condition and within-condition differences that are of interest, we developed ALDEx, an ANOVA-like differential expression procedure, to identify genes with greater between- to within-condition differences. We show that the presence of differential expression and the magnitude of these comparative differences can be reasonably estimated with even very small sample sizes.",

		"abstract": "Anthropogenic N deposition affects litter decomposition and soil organic matter (SOM) storage through multiple mechanisms. Microbial community responses to long-term N deposition were investigated in a sugar maple-dominated forest in northern Michigan during the 1998–2000 growing seasons. Litter and soil were collected from three fertilized plots (30kg N ha−1y−1) and three control plots. The activities of 10 extracellular enzymes (EEA) were assayed. ANOVA and meta-analysis techniques were used to compare treatment responses. EEA responses to N amendment were greater in litter than in soil (litter mean effect size [d]=0.534 std. dev.; soil d=0.308). Urease, acid phosphatase and glycosidase (β-glucosidase, α-glucosidase, cellobiohydrolase, β-xylosidase) activities increased in both soil and litter; mean responses ranged from 7 to 56%. N-Acetylglucosaminidase activity increased 14% in soil but decreased 4% in litter. Phenol oxidase activity dropped 40% in soil, but increased 63% in litter. These responses suggest that N deposition has increased litter decomposition rate and depressed SOM decomposition. In previous studies, loss of phenol oxidase activity in response to N deposition has been attributed to suppression of lignin-degrading basidiomycetes. However, the decline of this activity in bacterially-dominated soil suggest that N inhibition of recalcitrant organic matter decomposition may be a more general phenomenon.",

It provides taxonomic assignments from domain to genus, with confidence estimates for each assignment. The majority of classifications (98%) were of high estimated confidence (≥95%) and high accuracy (98%). In addition to being tested with the corpus of 5,014 type strain sequences from Bergey's outline, the RDP Classifier was tested with a corpus of 23,095 rRNA sequences as assigned by the NCBI into their alternative higher-order taxonomy. The results from leave-one-out testing on both corpora show that the overall accuracies at all levels of confidence for near-full-length and 400-base segments were 89% or above down to the genus level, and the majority of the classification errors appear to be due to anomalies in the current taxonomies. For shorter rRNA segments, such as those that might be generated by pyrosequencing, the error rate varied greatly over the length of the 16S rRNA gene, with segments around the V2 and V4 variable regions giving the lowest error rates. The RDP Classifier is suitable both for the analysis of single rRNA sequences and for the analysis of libraries of thousands of sequences. Another related tool, RDP Library Compare, was developed to facilitate microbial-community comparison based on 16S rRNA gene sequence libraries. It combines the RDP Classifier with a statistical test to flag taxa differentially represented between samples. The RDP Classifier and RDP Library Compare are available online at http://rdp.cme.msu.edu/ .",

We compiled nearly 1 million CO1 barcode sequences appropriate for classifying arthropods and chordates. Compared to our previous Insecta classifier, the current classifier has more than three times the taxonomic coverage, including outgroups, and is based on almost five times as many reference sequences. Unlike other popular rDNA metabarcoding markers, we show that classification performance is similar across the length of the CO1 barcoding region. We show that the RDP classifier can make taxonomic assignments about 19 times faster than the popular top BLAST hit method and reduce the false positive rate from nearly 100% to 34%. This is especially important in large-scale biodiversity and biomonitoring studies where datasets can become very large and the taxonomic assignment problem is not trivial. We also show that reference databases are becoming more representative of current species diversity but that gaps still exist. We suggest that it would benefit the field as a whole if all investigators involved in metabarocoding studies, through collaborations with taxonomic experts, also planned to barcode representatives of their local biota as a part of their projects.",

		"abstract": "<h3>Abstract</h3> <h3>Background</h3> <p>Multi-marker metabarcoding is increasingly being used to generate biodiversity information across different domains of life from microbes to fungi to animals such as in ecological and environmental studies. Current popular bioinformatic pipelines support microbial and fungal marker analysis, while ad hoc methods are used to process animal metabarcode markers from the same study. The purpose of this paper is to introduce MetaWorks, a ‘meta’barcode pipeline that does ‘the works’ and supports the bioinformatic processing of various metabarcoding markers including rRNA and their spacers as well as protein coding loci.</p><h3>Results</h3> <p>MetaWorks provides a Conda environment to quickly gather most of the programs and dependencies for the pipeline. MetaWorks is automated using Snakemake to ensure reproducibility and scalability. We have supplemented existing RDP-trained classifiers for SSU (prokaryotes), ITS (fungi), and LSU (fungi) with trained classifiers for COI (eukaryotes), rbcL (diatoms or eukaryotes), SSU (diatoms or eukaryotes), and 12S (fish). MetaWorks can process rRNA genes, but it can also properly handle ITS spacers by trimming flanking conserved rRNA gene regions, as well as handle protein coding genes by removing obvious pseudogenes.</p><h3>Conclusions</h3> <p>As far as we are aware, MetaWorks is the first flexible multi-marker metabarcode pipeline that can accommodate rRNA genes, spacer, and protein coding markers in the same pipeline. This is ideal for large-scale, multi-marker studies to provide a harmonized processing environment, pipeline, and taxonomic assignment approach. Updates to MetaWorks will be made as needed to reflect advances in the underlying programs, reference databases, or hidden Markov model (HMM) profiles for pseudogene filtering. Future developments will include support for additional metabarcode markers, RDP trained reference databases, and HMM profiles for pseudogene filtering.</p>",

		"abstract": "In focusing on how organisms' generalizable functional properties (traits) interact mechanistically with environments across spatial scales and levels of biological organization, trait-based approaches provide a powerful framework for attaining synthesis, generality and prediction. Trait-based research has considerably improved understanding of the assembly, structure and functioning of plant communities. Further advances in ecology may be achieved by exploring the trait–environment relationships of non-sessile, heterotrophic organisms such as terrestrial arthropods, which are geographically ubiquitous, ecologically diverse, and often important functional components of ecosystems. Trait-based studies and trait databases have recently been compiled for groups such as ants, bees, beetles, butterflies, spiders and many others; however, the explicit justification, conceptual framework, and primary-evidence base for the burgeoning field of ‘terrestrial arthropod trait-based ecology’ have not been well established. Consequently, there is some confusion over the scope and relevance of this field, as well as a tendency for studies to overlook important assumptions of the trait-based approach. Here we aim to provide a broad and accessible overview of the trait-based ecology of terrestrial arthropods. We first define and illustrate foundational concepts in trait-based ecology with respect to terrestrial arthropods, and justify the application of trait-based approaches to the study of their ecology. Next, we review studies in community ecology where trait-based approaches have been used to elucidate how assembly processes for terrestrial arthropod communities are influenced by niche filtering along environmental gradients (e.g. climatic, structural, and land-use gradients) and by abiotic and biotic disturbances (e.g. fire, floods, and biological invasions). We also review studies in ecosystem ecology where trait-based approaches have been used to investigate biodiversity–ecosystem function relationships: how the functional diversity of arthropod communities relates to a host of ecosystem functions and services that they mediate, such as decomposition, pollination and predation. We then suggest how future work can address fundamental assumptions and limitations by investigating trait functionality and the effects of intraspecific variation, assessing the potential for sampling methods to bias the traits and trait values observed, and enhancing the quality and consolidation of trait information in databases. A roadmap to guide observational trait-based studies is also presented. Lastly, we highlight new areas where trait-based studies on terrestrial arthropods are well positioned to advance ecological understanding and application. These include examining the roles of competitive, non-competitive and (multi-)trophic interactions in shaping coexistence, and macro-scaling trait–environment relationships to explain and predict patterns in biodiversity and ecosystem functions across space and time. We hope this review will spur and guide future applications of the trait-based framework to advance ecological insights from the most diverse eukaryotic organisms on Earth.",

		"abstract": "Thanks to sequencing technology, modern molecular bioscience datasets are often compositions of counts, e.g. counts of amplicons, mRNAs, etc. While there is growing appreciation that compositional data need special analysis and interpretation, less well understood is the discrete nature of these count compositions (or, as we call them, lattice compositions) and the impact this has on statistical analysis, particularly log-ratio analysis (LRA) of pairwise association. While LRA methods are scale-invariant, count compositional data are not; consequently, the conclusions we draw from LRA of lattice compositions depend on the scale of counts involved. We know that additive variation affects the relative abundance of small counts more than large counts; here we show that additive (quantization) variation comes from the discrete nature of count data itself, as well as (biological) variation in the system under study and (technical) variation from measurement and analysis processes. Variation due to quantization is inevitable, but its impact on conclusions depends on the underlying scale and distribution of counts. We illustrate the different distributions of real molecular bioscience data from different experimental settings to show why it is vital to understand the distributional characteristics of count data before applying and drawing conclusions from compositional data analysis methods.",

		"abstract": "In this paper, we summarize Ontario’s Long-term Soil Productivity (LTSP) experience focusing on our efforts to forge lasting research partnerships, highlight the approaches we feel were effective in getting emerging science into forest policy within an adaptive management (AM) framework, and describe the future direction of Ontario’s LTSP program as new policy issues are emerging as part of the continuous AM cycle. Fourteen installations were established on nutrient-poor, coniferdominated sites, considered to be the most sensitive to increased biomass removals. From 1993 to 1995, all sites were clearcut-harvested, with replicated (three reps per site) biomass removal treatments that included: stem only, full-tree, and full-tree + forest floor removal. Routine (every 5 years) measurements have been carried out to track changes in soil carbon and nutrient levels, as well as stand- and individual-tree growth and development metrics and foliar nutrition.The published results from Ontario’s LTSP program, in combination with the North American-wide LTSP synthesis outputs, have suggested that these nutrient-poor, conifer-dominated sites are less sensitive to biomass (nutrient) removals than previously thought. The evidence provided through peerreviewed publications, conference and workshop presentations, and field tours was substantive and led to a review and revision of the full-tree logging direction within Ontario’s guidelines. We conclude with a set of recommendations (lessons learned) for the successful delivery of any new long-term, interdisciplinary research projects examining the sustainability of forest-management practices.",

		"abstract": "Harvest impact on forest biodiversity has been widely studied, but for managers confronted with a need for integrated cross-taxa assessment, application remains a significant challenge. Using post-harvest boreal forest succession as a model system, we investigate the usefulness of a trait-based multi-taxa approach to improve our understanding of the community dynamics after disturbance. We assess the strength of response to forest harvesting and recovery patterns of four taxa with contrasting attributes (vegetation, carabids, spiders and birds) along a post-harvest chronosequence of jack pine stands in the boreal forests of Canada. We used a complementary set of functional and taxonomic diversity metrics to identify commonalities and dissimilarities in the community assembly processes and sensitivities to harvesting among taxa. Despite the overall similarity of community response for most pairs of taxa and metrics, the strength of cross-taxa congruency varied greatly among metrics, illustrating the complexity of taxa response to harvest as well as the necessity of including a variety of biodiversity metrics in impact assessments. Of the four selected taxa, spiders were found the most sensitive to harvesting, with a strong response to environmental changes after harvest and a slow community recovery process. Birds and carabids showed highly congruent response patterns, with a strong response to harvest followed by a marked recovery process. Ground vegetation was the most resilient to harvesting. We discuss the management implications of these contrasting recovery processes, outline the current limitations of this method and suggest steps toward the implementation of effective integrated multi-taxa monitoring programs.",

		"abstract": "Calcium (Ca) concentrations in lakes have declined in many regions, and concerns have been expressed that Ca levels are falling below biologically significant thresholds. Wood ash additions to soil are typically used to combat soil acidification, and it is unclear whether wood ash additions to upland soils will lead to higher Ca leaching to surface waters. In this study we applied fly ash or bottom ash at 4 Mg ha −1 and 8 Mg ha −1 to upland soils at replicated plots in Haliburton Forest in central Ontario and measured soil water chemistry at 3 depths over 4 years. Increases in soil water Ca concentration following application were quite modest and occurred primarily in the fly ash treatments in the upper depth (0.3 m) during the first 2 years following application. There was no concomi-tant increase in pH or acid-neutralizing capacity primarily because of the high sulphate leaching associated with the fly ash treatments. Overall, these results show that wood ash addition to soils at moderate doses will have little impact on soil export to lakes.",

This method has been used for more than 35 years and is still popular as a means to characterize microbial communities in a diverse range of environmental matrices. This review examines the various recent applications of PLFA analysis in environmental studies with specific reference to the interpretation of the PLFA results. It is evident that interpretations of PLFA results do not always correlate between different investigations. These discrepancies in interpretation and their subsequent applications to environmental studies are discussed. However, in spite of limitations to the manner in which PLFA data are applied, the approach remains one with great potential for improving our understanding of the relationship between microbial populations and the environment.

These studies share a common experimental design while encompassing a wide range of climate, site conditions, and forest types. Whole-tree harvest had limited effects on planted seedling performance compared with the effects of stem-only harvest (the control); slight increases in survival were usually offset by decreases in growth. Forest-floor removal improved seedling survival and increased growth in Mediterranean climates, but reduced growth on productive, nutrient-limited, warm–humid sites. Soil compaction with intact forest floors usually benefited conifer survival and growth, regardless of climate or species. Compaction combined with forest-floor removal generally increased survival, had limited effects on individual tree growth, and increased stand growth in Mediterranean climates. Vegetation control benefited seedling growth in all treatments, particularly on more productive sites, but did not affect survival or alter the relative impact of organic matter removal and compaction on growth. Organic matter removal increased aspen coppice densities and, as with compaction, reduced aspen growth.",

Two wood-derived bottom ashes (low-carbon gasifier ash and high-carbon boiler ash) were applied at 5000 kg ha−1 (dry weight equivalent) with urea (100 kg N ha−1), in a twoway factorial randomized block design across two (18- and 24-yr-old) hybrid spruce (Picea glauca × engelmannii Parry × Engelm.) plantations in interior British Columbia. Changes in spruce foliar nutrients and selected soil properties were evaluated. After one growing season, foliar Ca and S significantly increased in plots treated with ash, and foliar N significantly increased while foliar Mg and P significantly decreased in spruce treated with urea. In LFH horizons, soil pH, exchangeable base cations (Ca, Mg, and K), strong acid-extractable B, and Ca significantly increased (p < 0.05) with ash addition; soil pH was greatest in plots treated with urea plus gasifier ash. No significant treatment effects were observed in underlying mineral soil. We conclude that gasifier and boiler ash derived from clean wood applied at 5000 kg ha−1 are effective soil amendments as expressed within 1 yr by changes in nutrient status of LFH horizons and spruce foliage.",

Plots were established with ﬂy ash and bottom ash treatments of 0, 1, 4, and 8 Mg·ha−1 (n = 4), and cover boards were positioned both with and without ash beneath. One year following ash additions, salamander abundance had increased under boards with ﬂy ash beneath, and bottom ash had no effect. Soil pH and electrical conductivity increased under cover boards with ash beneath them and for uncovered soil, and the effects were strongest under cover boards with ash beneath. The effects of ash were generally stronger at higher dosages, and ﬂy ash was stronger than bottom ash. The moisture holding capacity of ﬂy ash was 60% higher than the soil and was 63% lower than the soil for bottom ash, but they had little effect on moisture of the forest ﬂoor. These results suggest that ash altered salamander abundance via soil pH and moisture and would not inhibit salamander movement over the forest ﬂoor.",

Less attention has been paid to the ash generated when forest biomass is combusted to produce energy. In Canada, this ash is often landfilled, but in some countries, wood ash is applied to the soil to maintain or improve soil fertility and forest health. AshNet is a network of Canadian scientists, foresters, policy makers and industry representatives that has formed to address opportunities for and challenges to the use of wood ash as a forest soil amendment. To date, AshNet collaborators have produced a guide to navigating the regulatory approval process, and completed a techno-economic analysis of the costs associated with landfilling wood ash versus using it as a forest soil amendment. Practical methods for optimizing ash quality and applying it on forested sites are being investigated. Applications of wood ash are also being examined as a tool for emulating some of the effects of wildfire on soil chemistry. The results of research trials established by AshNet collaborators across Canada will be shared to help develop and refine forest management policies and practices surrounding soil applications of wood ash. Updates on AshNet’s activities are available at (http://cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/projects/140 (English); http://scf.rncan.gc.ca/projets/140?lang=fr_CA (French)).",

		"abstract": "The contribution of forest biomass to Canada’s energy production is small but growing. As the forest bioenergy industry in Canada expands, there is growing interest in more sustainably managing the wood ash that is generated as a by-product. Despite being rich in nutrients, wood ash is usually landﬁlled in Canada. Soil applications of ash in Canadian forests could be used to mimic some of the effects of wildﬁre, to replace nutrients removed during harvesting, to counteract the negative effects of acid deposition, and to improve tree growth. At present, the provincial and territorial processes for obtaining regulatory approval to use wood ash as a forest soil amendment can be challenging to navigate. Furthermore, the costs for obtaining approval and transporting and applying wood ash to the soil can render landﬁlling a more cost-effective method of ash management. To ensure that wood ash applications in Canadian forests are conducted safely, effectively, and efﬁciently, experience from European countries could provide a useful starting point for developing best practices. The results of Canadian research trials will assist policy makers and forest managers in reﬁning management guidelines that encourage soil applications of wood ash as a forest management tool while protecting the ecology, water quality, biodiversity, and productivity of Canadian forests.",

Two hybrid spruce (Picea glauca X engelmannii) plantations in interior British Columbia were treated with two types of bioenergy-produced wood ash (high carbon boiler ash and low carbon gasifier ash) with or without nitrogen fertilizer in a two-way factorial block design. Ash and nitrogen treatments were applied to 8.0 m radius plots at a rate of 5000 kg ha-1 loose ash (dry basis), and 100 kg N ha-1 of urea in pellet form. Changes in understory vegetation cover were observed. There was a significant (p<0.05) effect of nitrogen and wood ash plus nitrogen application on understory vegetation community composition, with nitrogen application having the greatest effect. Discriminant function analysis indicated a differential response of species group to ash/ nitrogen treatments, though the effect size was small. We conclude that short-term changes to understory vegetation are minimal when these two ashes were applied at a rate of 5000 kg ha-1. Continued monitoring will determine if any long-term effects become apparent with time.",

		"abstract": "The burning of wood for bioenergy produces signiﬁcant amounts of ash residue that requires disposal. We constructed a cost model to evaluate the unit costs of three ash disposal methods in the Canadian context: landﬁlls owned and operated by the bioenergy facility, municipal landﬁlls, and forest site application. The model accounts for costs related to the pretreatment, transportation, and disposal of ash at a landﬁll or forest site. Model parameter values were assigned appropriate distributions (based on published literature and industry surveys), and Monte Carlo simulations were employed to produce a range of model outputs for each disposal option. Results indicate that existing landﬁlls (if available for ash disposal) are likely the most cost-effective option (median value of $77 per tonne), although applying ash to a forest site is only ϳ15%–20% more costly (median value of $92 per tonne). Indeed, the unit cost estimates across disposal options have considerable overlap. This suggests that close examination of ﬁrm-speciﬁc circumstances is highly warranted when choosing a disposal approach, even in the absence of accounting for potential environmental beneﬁts associated with forest site disposal of ash.",

Neither ash nor biochar consistently increased seedling growth; instead sugar maple and red pine seedlings often had opposing responses to the same amendment–soil combination. Overall, these results indicate that it is important to carefully consider both the chemical and physical characteristics of the soil and the ash or biochar, as well as the nutrient requirements of the target tree species, to effectively use these amendments to reduce P limitation.",

The objectives of this study were (1) to evaluate soil chemistry, in particular soil acidity, after the application of three alkaline residuals from the pulp and paper industry, and (2) to determine if these alkaline residuals altered soil greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions as a result of the change in soil pH or due to their chemical composition. Soil properties and GHG fluxes were monitored for two years after alkaline residuals were applied to six forest sites dominated by sugar maple in southeastern Quebec, Canada. Each site received six treatments: wood ash applied at 5, 10 and 20 t ha-1, lime mud (7.5 t ha-1), a mixture of slaker grits and green liquor sludge (7 t ha-1) and an unamended control. These treatments had acid-neutralizing power from 0 to 9 t ha-1. All alkaline residuals buffered soil acidity as a function of their neutralizing power, and more neutralization occurred in the forest floor layer than in the underlying mineral soil. In the forest floor, the alkaline residual treatments significantly increased pH by more than one unit, nearly doubled the base saturation, and reduced exchangeable acidity, Al and Fe concentrations compared to control plots. The CO2 and N2O fluxes were lower after application of alkaline residuals, and this was related to the soil pH increase and the type of alkaline residual applied. Lime mud was more effective at reducing GHG fluxes than other alkaline residuals. We conclude that these alkaline residuals can effectively counteract soil acidity in sugar maple forests without increasing soil GHG emissions, at least in the short term.",

The disposal of wood ash and/or pulp and paper mill sludges is becoming increasingly more challenging as landfills are more difficult to site due to diminishing land availability and public opposition, as well as more costly to construct and operate because of increasingly stringent regulations. The most notable alternative to disposal that is receiving the attention of the forest industry is land application. The objective of this study, therefore, was to determine the influence of applying a pulp mill wood/sludge ash mixture on 1) various soil chemical properties of an Orthic Gray Luvisol and 2) the growth and nutrient uptake of white spruce [Picea glauca (Moench) Voss] seedlings. The pulp mill wood/sludge ash mixture from an olivine burner was surface broadcast at rates of 1 and 5 Mg ha–1 around white spruce seedlings planted on disc-trenched microsites. Soil solutions from lysimeters and soil samples were analyzed for exchangeable elements, soil pH and electrical conductivity while white spruce tissue samples were analyzed for various elements. Applications of pulp mill wood/sludge ash material significantly increased the soil pH from 4.8 to 6.9, resulting in increased soil extractable and soil solution P, Ca, and Mg. Soil electrical conductivity (EC) was increased from about 0.02 dS m–1 to approximately 0.10 dS m–1 by the heavier application rate of ash. In addition, at higher ash application rates, white spruce seedling growth was significantly decreased, suggesting salt phytotoxicity effects from the ash. These results indicate that with proper rate determination and management of salt effects, land application of this material would not appear to pose serious problems for white spruce seedling establishment.",

We investigated the feasibility of using small, mainly residential sources of non-industrial wood ash (NIWA) for this purpose by quantifying concentrations of its major nutrients and metals, its toxicity to Daphnia in aqueous extracts, and estimating the amount of NIWA available in the District of Muskoka in central Ontario. Locally collected NIWA averaged 30% Ca, and also contained smaller but significant amounts of K, Mg, Na, and P. Of these, K was so soluble that it was toxic to Daphnia over 48 h in the concentrate and 10-fold dilution; however, sedimented ash was not toxic over 15 d. Most metal levels in NIWA were below targets permitting unrestricted land application. However, Cu and Zn were just above these targets, but well below those for conditional use. Muskoka residents generate about 235 000 kg of NIWA annually, not enough to treat all central Ontario areas affected; however, a NIWA recycling programme implemented across southern Ontario could generate enough ash to solve the Ca decline problem in Muskoka’s forests and lakes.",

Fungal rhizomorphs and mycelia were sampled from sand-filled mesh bags with or without amendment of apatite or wood ash. The mesh bags were buried in forest soil in the field for 13 or 24 months. Elemental composition of the samples was analyzed with particle-induced X-ray emission and the fungus was identified by polymerase chain reaction^restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of the ITS-region of ribosomal DNA. The majority of rhizomorphs and mycelia collected from the mesh bags were of mycorrhizal origin with Paxillus involutus being the most common species (31%). Other identified species were Thelephora terrestris, Suillus granulatus and Tylospora fibillosa. S. granulatus contained 3^15 times more K (3 mg g31) than the other species and had large calcium-rich crystals deposited on the surface of rhizomorphs when grown in contact with apatite. P. involutus contained the largest amount of Ca (2^7 mg g31). Wood ash addition increased the amount of Ti, Mn and Pb in the rhizomorphs while apatite addition increased the amount of Ca in the rhizomorphs. The high concentration of K in S. granulatus rhizomorphs suggests that this fungus is a good accumulator of K while P. involutus appeared to accumulate heavy metals originating from wood ash.",

		"abstract": "Forest soil from an experimental Norway spruce forest with four levels of wood ash addition (0, 1, 3 and 6 tonnes ha−1) was used to inoculate pine (Pinus sylvestris) seedlings with indigenous ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi. Uptake of 32P and 86Rb in a root bioassay was used to estimate the demand for P and K by seedlings grown in the different soils. Utilisation of P from apatite was tested in a laboratory system where uptake by the ectomycorrhizal mycelium was separated from uptake by roots. The demand for P and K in the seedlings was similar regardless of the ash treatment. Variation in EM levels, estimated as fungal biomass (ergosterol) in roots, was large in the different soils, but not related to ash addition. Uptake of P from apatite was, on average, 23% of total seedling P and was not related to EM levels. It was concluded that the improved P uptake from apatite by EM fungi found in earlier studies is probably not a general phenomenon among EM fungi. The small effect of ash addition on EM levels and P uptake suggests that addition of granulated wood ash is a forest management treatment that will have only minor influence on ectomycorrhizal symbiosis.",

In addition to control plots, three treatments were tested: granulated wood ash at 4150 kg dry weight (dw) ha(1, a nitrogen-free, dolomite-based vitality fertilizer (SkogVital) at 2 )1500 kg ha(1 and the fine fraction of harvest residues (mostly needles) at 15,050 kg dw ha(1. The treatments had no short-term effect on height increment. Nitrogen (N) was probably the growth-limiting element, but phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) were also in suboptimum supply. The vitality fertilizer increased the foliar concentration (or the element/N ratio) of P, calcium (Ca) and zinc, while ash application increased the foliar Ca/N ratio. The vitality fertilizer also increased magnesium and Ca concentrations in roots and decreased aluminium concentrations, whereas logging residues and wood ash only increased manganese concentrations in roots. Thus, the vitality fertilizer had a more marked effect on tree nutrient status than the granulated wood ash.",

		"abstract": "Wildfires may produce several changes in the short- and longterm in the landscape and in the soil system. The magnitude of these changes induced by fire in the components of ecosystems (water, soil, vegetation and fauna) depends on fire properties (fire intensity and severity) and environmental factors (vegetation, soil, geomorphology, etc.). The most important impacts on soils in the short-term are the reduction of vegetation cover (which increases soil erosion risk), the deposition of ash after combustion of biomass, the induction of enhancement of water repellency and changes in the structure and soil components. Combustion of biomass and soil organic matter also results in the release of gases and other pollutants into the atmosphere. Similarly, the changes induced by fire on the biological soil components (vegetation, animals and soil microorganisms) may occur rapidly and produce a large-scale response. The long-term effects of fire on soils and water may well persist for relatively short periods (hours, days or months), long (years or tens of years), or be permanent depending on the severity of fire and fire regime. Some of these effects are a consequence of the relationship between fire, soil, hydrology and nutrient cycling.",

		"abstract": "We examined the effect of wood ash (WA) fertilization on microbial processes in the mineral top soil (0 –5 cm) of an acidic Norway spruce forest. Plots treated with a single application of WA (8 t ha21) were compared with untreated control plots. At ﬁve sampling times (1, 4, 15, 62 and 460 d) after the addition of WA, various soil microbiological variables such as microbial biomass C (Cmic), basal respiration (soil native CO2 release), in situ soil respiration (CO2 efﬂux at the soil surface), as well as enzyme activities (acid and alkaline phosphatase, urease, and protease) were determined. Soil chemical properties measured included pH, organic C and total N, and exchangeable cations. WA amendment resulted in a rapid change in the rate of CO2 evolution and Cmic. It appeared that an increase in microbial activity in soil treated with WA was accompanied by an increase in the growth rate of soil microorganisms. At sampling dates 4 and 15 d after WA application, Cmic and CO2 evolution rates increased by factors of 1.6 and 1.9, respectively. After 460 d, differences in the CO2 evolution and Cmic in the control and WA treated plots were still evident. A similar effect could also be shown in situ with higher CO2 efﬂux from the soil surface in the WA treated plots. Higher biomass and bioactivity was related to the increases in the pH and in the quantity of nutrients after the WA had been added to the soil. The higher activity was linked to increased mineralization of organic matter, which was followed by decreases in the soil total C and N contents in the ﬁrst day after treatment. The enzyme activities responded only weakly to the WA treatment. The higher supply of inorganic P from WA led to a small depression in phosphatase activity. In contrast, the enzyme activities of the N-cycle were stimulated by the addition of WA, which had a low N content. q 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",

		"abstract": "Laboratory and greenhouse experiments were carried out to characterize and examine wood ash from a biomass-fueled commercial power plant as a lime. Experimental treatments include wood ash and two commercial limes applied at six application rates. The effective calcium carbonate equivalence (ECCE) of wood ash ranged from 22 to 49%. Wood ash increased soil pH by 0.31–3.18 over unlimed soils, and these changes in pH were similar to the effect of commercial limes. The soil pH at three weeks after wood ash application was constant through week seventeen. Wood ash increased electrical conductivity by 0.13–0.63 dS m−1 compared to unlimed soils at three weeks after liming; however, a 39–69% decreased was observed by week seventeen. Common bermudagrass did not respond to the application of wood ash and commercial limes. The results of this study suggest that wood ash from the biomass-fueled commercial power plant with low ECCE could be a liming material.",

		"abstract": "The present review aims to summarize current knowledge in the topic of wood ash application to boreal forest and aquatic ecosystems, and the different effects derived from these actions. Much research has been conducted regarding the effects of wood ash application on forest growth. Present studies show that, generally speaking, forest growth can be increased on wood ash–ameliorated peatland rich in nitrogen. On mineral soils, however, no change or even decreased growth have been reported. The effects on ground vegetation are not very clear, as well as the effects on fungi, soil microbes, and soildecomposing animals. The discrepancies between different studies are for the most part explained by abiotic factors such as variation in fertility among sites, different degrees of stabilization, and wood ash dosage used, and different time scales among different studies. The lack of knowledge in the field of aquatic ecosystems and their response to ash application is an important issue for future research. The few studies conducted have mainly considered changes in water chemistry. The biotoxic effects of ash application can roughly be divided into two categories: primary and secondary. Among the primary effects is toxicity deriving from compounds in the wood ash and cadmium is probably the worst among these. The secondary effects of wood ash are generally due to its alkaline capacity and a release of ions into the soil and soil water, and finally, watercourses and lakes. Given current knowledge, we would recommend site- and wood ash–specific application practices, rather than broad and general guidelines for wood ash application to forests.",

The results show no indication of biotoxic effects due to wood ash (adjusted to neutral) treatments. However, when no adjustments of pH in wood ash solutions were made, inhibitory effects on motile factors and cell growth were observed at higher concentrations of wood ash (10–25 g L−1) due to high pH (>8). In tests with pH adjusted to neutral, enhanced motility was observed. These results indicate that high concentration of WAA could affect freshwater environments.",

Studies on the effects of wood ash on aquatic organisms and ecosystems are, however, few. This study investigated the effects of wood ash (0.1–10 g l− 1) on the freshwater moss Fontinalis antipyretica Hedw., which has previously been shown to be a sensitive test organism for assessing environmental pollution. After nine weeks of treatment with wood ash, a significant effect of enhanced stem growth was observed at higher concentrations (1–10 g l− 1). The concentration of wood ash was also correlated with the growth of secondary branches. Photosynthesis (oxygen evolution after 4 h of exposure to wood ash) was significantly lower in the alkaline treatments (no pH adjustment) compared to the treatments with neutral wood ash solutions (pH adjusted to 7.5). Furthermore, photosynthesis in the alkaline wood ash treatments was significantly lower compared to the control. The ratio between the optical density value before and after acidification (OD665/665a) was higher for all wood ash concentrations compared to the control. The OD665/665a values ranged from 1.52 to 1.61 and there was a difference, however not significant, between the alkaline and the neutral treatment at 10 g l− 1 wood ash. This study clearly demonstrated that wood ash may be beneficial for F. antipyretica at moderate concentrations (0.5–5 g l−1), particularly when a sudden increase in pH is avoided.",

		"abstract": "In Sweden, whole tree harvest is common practice, possibly leading to the depletion of mineral nutrients. Furthermore, the increased use of forestry residues for heat production has caused an increasingly growing amount of by-product consisting of wood ash. Therefore, the Swedish Forest Agency has recommended wood ash application (WAA) to replace the mineral nutrients removed by whole tree harvesting, as well as a means to mitigate the acidiﬁcation of boreal forests and surface waters. In a multidisciplinary study during 2003–2006 in Bispga˚rden (Sweden), we have investigated the limnological effects on a ﬁrst order stream after WAA (conducted in 2004; 3000 kg haÀ1) to a 50-ha forested catchment. In general, no signiﬁcant effects on an annual basis were found for acidiﬁcation parameters, such as pH, alkalinity and toxic forms of aluminum (Al). There was, however, evidence of an increased pH during the spring ﬂood, accompanied by a simultaneous decrease in the frequency of low pHvalues (<5.6). Moreover, alkalinity increased in the years 2005 and 2006 compared to that of 2003, although the increase in 2006 was not statistically different from that in 2005 or 2003. High concentrations of Al repeatedly occurred in the stream, and the WAA did not affect the frequencies of high concentrations of toxic Al forms (>50 mg lÀ1). The benthic diatom community did not change as a result of the wood ash treatment and the diatom-based index IPS (Indice de PulluoSensibilite´) indicated no nutrient enrichment or organic pollution of the stream water. There were, however, indices of elevated concentrations of potassium (K) in the aquatic moss Fontinalis antipyretica and in leaves from Alder (Alnus incana). We conclude that wood ash treatment of a forested catchment with the dose and form of ash applied in this study did not modify the freshwater ecosystem of a ﬁrst order stream.",

		"abstract": "Nutrient concentrations in current and 1-year-old needles were analyzed annually for 5 years after application of hardened wood ash in 1–4-year-old Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) stands within a range of climate and fertility gradients. At each site, 3000 kg ha−1 hardened wood ash of two types, Nymölla and Perstorp, was applied in a randomized block design. Wood ash Nymölla contained 12 kg ha−1 P, 30 kg ha−1 K, 891 kg ha−1 Ca, 72 kg ha−1 Mg and wood ash Perstorp contained 12 kg ha−1 P, 60 kg ha−1 K, 486 kg ha−1 Ca, and 60 kg ha−1 Mg. The ash was intended to compensate for nutrients removed at the preceding harvest when logging residues were collected and removed from the site (whole-tree harvesting). The climate gradient included four climate zones throughout Sweden and each of these included a fertility gradient of three sites classiﬁed according to their ground vegetation type. There were no effects on nutrient concentrations in the needles 1 year after the application of wood ash. Five years after ash application, the concentrations of P, K and Ca in current and 1-year-old needles were higher than in the control plots. The results were consistent over all stands, irrespective of climate zone and fertility status. P and K concentrations were higher in spruce needles from plots treated with Perstorp wood ash, whereas Ca concentrations were higher in those of Nymölla treated plots. Analyses across all study sites revealed a treatment effect in terms of increased ratios of P:N, K:N and Ca:N in 1-year-old needles. The ratio P:N tended to increase with time in the Perstorp wood ash treatment compared with the control. The needle concentrations of Mg and S were not affected by the ash applications. The increase in needle nutrient concentrations after application of hardened wood ash suggests that wood ash recycling could be used in order to replace nutrients removed at whole-tree harvesting.",

The pH had been changed by addition of lime and wood-ash from 4.34.4 to 7.0 in one soil and from 3.94.4 to 6.1 in the other. Higher total microbial activities and higher bacterial growth rates, measured as soil respiration rate and thymidine incorporation rate, respectively, were found in the treatments with increased pH. Similar effects of soil pH on the thymidine incorporation rate were found using two different methods, by measuring rates in either a soil slurry with all bacteria present or using a subsample of bacteria extracted from soil after homogenization-centrifugation. The number of culturable bacteria was up to 5.1 times higher in the high pH soils, while the acridine orange direct counts were unaffected by the treatments. Thus, the proportions of culturable bacteria increased in the limed and ash-treated soils compared to the untreated controls. An altered bacterial community composition due to liming was indicated by an altered response to pH, where the pH of the soil was correlated to the optimum pH for growth of the bacterial community. The ATP content of the soil was unaffected or increased in treatments with high pH compared to the control, while microbial biomass estimated by the substrate induced respiration technique (SIR) was always higher in limed and ash-treated plots.",

		"abstract": "There is a great need to increase the production in Swedish forests to meet future demand from the forest industry and the bio-energy sector. One option to increase the production is to supply nutrients to young stands of Norway spruce. For the practical application it is important to develop and optimise fertilisation regimes in terms of production, economy and leaching of nutrients. The frequency of fertilisation is one important variable in the fertilisation regime, and this study aimed to study effects of different fertilisation frequencies on production and leaching of nitrogen. In 2001, ﬁve ﬁeld experiments were established in southern, central and northern Sweden. Young stands of Norway spruce were fertilised every year, every second year and every third year. In addition, fertilisation with sludge pellets and wood-ash combined with nitrogen was investigated. The current annual increment after ﬁve years of treatment was signiﬁcantly larger in fertilised than in unfertilised treatments. The difference in production between fertilisation every year and every second year was insigniﬁcant, while fertilisation every third year resulted in lower production. Sludge pellets and wood-ash fertilisation gave signiﬁcantly lower production than fertilisation every second year even though approximately the same amount of nitrogen was applied. There was relatively little leaching of nitrate to ground water in all treatments; 0.6–1 kg N ha–1 a–1 from plots with fertilisation every year or every second year; and 2.7 kg N ha–1 a–1 from plots with fertilisation every third year. Most of the leaching was after the ﬁrst fertilisation, in all treatments at all sites.",

		"abstract": "Additions of fire residues in the form of charcoal and wood ash may better emulate natural disturbance processes in managed boreal forests. We examined the effects of a poplar (Populus) wood biochar and a high-carbon wood ash on soil and vegetation in a 3-year experiment in northwestern Ontario, Canada. Both soil amendments increased soil pH and soil Ca levels; high-carbon wood ash also increased soil Cu, Zn, B, S, and Pb. Amendments had large effects on plant community composition, favoring a subset of ruderal species including raspberry (Rubus idaeus L.) and goldenrod (Solidago canadensis L.). The addition of high-carbon wood ash resulted in declines in growth of planted white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss); a path analysis suggests that this was due to the effects of toxic elements rather than the indirect effects of competition. We conclude that high-carbon wood ash, while qualifying as a type of biochar and having some beneficial effects on soil properties, can enhance toxic metals in boreal forest soils, with negative consequences to early tree growth. Differences in plant species responses to biochars and the potential for toxicity effects and indirect effects mediated by plant competition will require screening and field trials of potential biochars prior to their use in operational forestry and forest restoration.",

		"abstract": "The effects of wood ash application on soil microbial processes were investigated in three drained forested peatlands, which differed in nutrient status and time since application. Measured variables included the concentrations of soil elements and phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs), net nitrogen (N) mineralization, nitriﬁcation and denitriﬁcation enzyme activity, potential methane (CH4) oxidation, CH4 production and microbial respiration kinetics. Wood ash application had a considerable inﬂuence on soil element concentrations. This mirrored a decrease in the majority of the microbial biomarkers by more than one-third in the two oligotrophic peatlands, although the microbial community composition was not altered. The decreases in PLFAs coincided with reduced net ammoniﬁcation and net N mineralization. Other measured variables did not change systematically as a result of wood ash application. No signiﬁcant changes in microbial biomass or processes were found in the mesotrophic peatland, possibly because too little time (1 year) had elapsed since the wood ash application. This study suggests that oligotrophic peatlands can be substantially affected by wood ash for a period of at least 4 years after application. However, within 25 years of the wood ash application, the microbial biomass seemed to have recovered or adapted to enhanced element concentrations in the soil.",

The objective of this study was to determine the relevant chemical and physical properties of selected mixtures of aspen burner-ash, log-yard waste scrapings (sandy soil plus wood waste) and a sandy soil as an intermediate landﬁll cover. The treatment mixtures, per weight basis, included: (1) 100% sand; (2) 80/20 log-yard waste/ash; (3) 50/50 sand/ash; (4) 40/30/30 sand/log-yard waste/ash; (5) 60/40 ash/log-yard waste; (6) 100% ash; (7) 100% log-yard waste. All treatments containing ash had a very high pH (12.8–13.3) and electrical conductivity (39–105 dS m−1). The ash contained signiﬁcant amounts of beneﬁcial nutrients, but soil solution dominance by sodium carbonate suppressed concentrations of calcium and magnesium. Treatments containing ash showed lower bulk densities but relatively higher soil strength values (2.5–3.5 kg cm−2) than that for the log-yard waste scrapings or the sandy soil, due to its self-cementing properties. Mixtures of soil material and ash had lower hydraulic conductivity rates (∼1.0 × 10−4 cm s−1) and lower inﬁltration rates compared to the sandy soil (∼5 × 10−3 cm s−1) or log-yard waste scrapings or pure ash. Water holding capacity increased with treatments containing ash. A soil–water balance model used to determine percolation rates through a 60 cm layer of treatment material showed that treatments containing a mixture of ash and soil material decreased the downward ﬂow of water throughout the year.",

		"abstract": "In this paper, the environmental impact of logging residue recovery (LRR) and nutrient compensation (NC) in Sweden is analysed and evaluated economically. Logging residue recovery and recirculation of wood ash can generate local environmental beneÿts, such as reduced soil acidiÿcation and, primarily in southern Sweden, also improved nitrogen balance and reduced nutrient leaching from forest land. Recovery of residues leads to a slight increase in net emissions of carbon dioxide, compared with on site decomposition, but this increase is small compared with the net emissions of carbon dioxide from fossil fuel cycles. The impact of toxic compounds is estimated to be insigniÿcant, as is that on biodiversity, when current guidelines for forestry management methods are followed. The total cost, including direct costs and environmental costs=beneÿts, of LRR and NC is estimated to be about 1.1, 3.3 and 4.6 US$=GJ in southern, central and northern Sweden, respectively. For comparison, the current direct cost of LRR, excluding NC, is, on average, about 4:0 US$=GJ in Sweden. Almost one-third of the Swedish forest fuel potential is estimated to be located in the south, but this potential varies from about 50 to over 100 PJ per year depending on the assumptions made. Thus, when local environmental beneÿts are also considered, the overall economic beneÿt derived from the utilisation of forest fuels could increase signiÿcantly in southern Sweden, where large quantities of logging residues are available. c 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Wood ashes can also be regarded as a measure against soil acidification. Wood ashes were applied at various rates to the soil in a 35 years old pine (Pinus sylvestris, L) stand at Ringam~a in Blekinge, South Sweden. The experiments started in 1984. The different treatments gave a clear effect on soil chemistry with decreased acidity and aluminum ion concentrations. The base saturation increased in both mor and upper mineral soil layers. Generally no significant increases were found in soil concentrations of heavy metals, except for Cu which increased significantly in the mor layer. Also the extractable Mn concentration increased, in spite of the increased pH in the soil after application of ashes. In order to achieve a biological circulation of nutrients through ash application without polluting the environment, it is of ultimate importance that the wood chips used in power plants and other furnaces have a low concentration of heavy metals and other pollutants.",

		"abstract": "Wood ash was applied to a forest ecosystem with the aim to recycle nutrients taken from the forest and to mitigate the negative effects of intensive harvesting. After two years, the application of 8,000 kg ha−1 of wood ash increased soil exchangeable Ca and Mg. Similarly, an increase in Ca and Mg in the Norway spruce ﬁne roots was recorded, leading to signiﬁcant linear correlations between soil and root Ca and soil and root Mg. In contrast to these macronutrients, the micronutrients Fe and Zn and the toxic element Al decreased in the soil exchangeable fraction with the addition of wood ash, but not in the ﬁne roots. Only Mn decreased in soil and in ﬁne roots leading to a signiﬁcant linear correlation between soil and root Mn. In soil, as well as in ﬁne roots, strong positive correlations were found between the elements Ca and Mg and between Fe and Al. This indicates that the uptake of Mg resembles that of Ca and that of Al that of Fe. With the wood ash application, the pH increased from 3.2 to 4.8, the base saturation from 30% to 86%, the molar basic cations/Al ratio (BC/Al) of the soil solution from 1.5 to 5.5, and the molar Ca/Al ratio of the ﬁne roots from 1.3 to 3.7. Overall, all below-ground indicators of soil acidiﬁcation responded positively to the wood ash application within two years. Nitrate concentrations increased only slightly in the soil solution at a soil depth of 75–80 cm, and no signs of increased heavy metal concentrations in the soils or in the ﬁne roots were apparent. This suggests that the recycling of wood ash could be an integral part of sustainable forest management because it closes the nutrient cycle and reverses soil acidiﬁcation.",

The objective of this study was to examine the effects of wood ash application on concentrations, storage, and distribution of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in a Swiss forest soil. In May 1998, we added 8 Mg wood ash haϪ1 to a forest soil. We determined 20 PAHs and 14 PCBs in the organic layer, in the bulk mineral soil, and in soil material taken from preferential flow paths and from the matrix before and after the wood ash application. In the control plots, the concentrations of PAHs in the organic layer indicated moderate pollution (sum of 20 PAHs: 0.8–1.6 mg kgϪ1 ), but sum of PCB concentrations was high (21–48 ␮g kgϪ1 ). The wood ash had high concentrations of PAHs (sum of 20 PAHs: 16.8 mg kgϪ1 ), but low concentrations of PCBs (sum of 14 PCBs: 3.4 ␮g kgϪ1 ). The wood ash application increased the PAH concentrations in the organic horizons up to sixfold. In contrast, PCB concentrations did not change in the Oa horizon and decreased up to one third in the Oi and Oe horizons. The decrease was probably caused by the mobilization of stored PCBs because of the high pH of the wood ash. This probably results in a higher mobility of dissolved organic matter, acting as PCB carrier. In the mineral soil, the preferential flow paths of the A horizon contained more PAHs and PCBs (ϩ20 Ϯ 15% and ϩ43 Ϯ 60%, respectively) than the matrix. This was particularly true for higher molecular weight compounds (molecular weight Ͼ 200 g molϪ1 ). Below 50 cm depth, concentrations of PAHs and PCBs were smaller in the preferential flow paths, suggesting that in deeper depths, processes acting as sinks dominated over inputs in the preferential flow paths.",

Our objective was to investigate whether preferential ¯ow paths have higher microbial biomass and different microbial community structures than the rest of the soil. We stained the preferential ¯ow paths in a forest soil with a food dye and sampled soil material from preferential ¯ow paths and from the soil matrix at four depths down to 1 m. Distinct differences in physico±chemical properties between preferential ¯ow paths and soil matrix existed and, thus, different environmental living conditions for microorganisms. The experimental addition of wood ash increased pH and base saturation in the preferential ¯ow paths to a higher extent than in the soil matrix, highlighting the importance of preferential ¯ow paths for solute input into the mineral soil. The organic C concentrations were approximately 10±70% higher in the preferential ¯ow paths than in the matrix. The organic N concentrations were also enriched in the preferential ¯ow paths, as well as the effective cation exchange capacity and the base saturation. Microbial biomass determined with the fumigation-extraction method was 9±92% higher in the preferential ¯ow paths than in the soil matrix, probably due to the better nutrient and substrate supply. The DNA concentrations and direct cell counts showed a similar pattern, while domain-speci®c genetic ®ngerprints based on small subunit ribosomal RNA genes did not re¯ect the differences between preferential ¯ow paths and soil matrix. Eukarya and Archaea only showed a depth-dependence and Bacteria showed no changes with ¯ow region or with depths. However, Pseudomonas displayed different community structures between preferential ¯ow paths and soil matrix. This indicated that possibly only few communities with a broad acceptance for substrates and aerobic as well as anaerobic growth speci®cally pro®t from the favourable conditions in the preferential ¯ow paths. q 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

		"abstract": "As a consequence of heterogeneous transport in soils, only a small part of the soil might be responsible for sorbing incoming elements. After staining preferential ¯ow paths in forested Dystric Cambisol with a colour dye, we sampled soil material from the ¯ow paths and from the soil matrix. We measured chemical properties and sorption isotherms of these two ¯ow regions and estimated the signi®cance of preferential ¯ow paths for the transport of solutes leached from wood ash applied at the surface. In the A horizon (0±9 cm depth), the cation exchange capacity of the ¯ow paths was 83.8 mmolc kg±1, while that of the soil matrix was only 74.6 mmolc kg±1. The base saturation was 42% and soil organic matter content was 41% larger in ¯ow paths than in the soil matrix. The sorption capacity for Cu was also larger than in the matrix, whereas the sorption capacity for Sr was similar in both ¯ow regions. The impact of the addition of 8 t wood ash ha±1 on soil chemical properties was restricted mainly to the ¯ow paths in the uppermost 20 cm of the soil; it was negligible in the matrix and at greater depths. Concentrations of exchangeable Ca in the ¯ow paths increased nearly 10-fold during the 6 months following the addition of the wood ash, and those of organically bound Pb by 50%. The opposite effect was found for exchangeable Al. Our results show that only part of the whole soil volume, approximately 50% of 0±20 cm in our study, is involved in transporting and sorbing the elements applied with the wood ash or as tracers. Such differences must be considered when calculating the maximal impact of any addition of fertilizer, wood ash, or liming agent.",

		"abstract": "Application of wood ash on forest and agricultural soils can provide nutrients and increase soil pH, however, it changes the soil chemistry rapidly and temporarily, often resulting in reduced plant growth and potassium leaching. Biochar from woody materials are nutrient poor and need nutrient enhancement prior to soil application. In this study, spruce residues were mixed with spruce/pine ash in different ratios (0e50%) to produce biochar-ash composites at 450 \u0014C. The biochar yield (ash-free basis) increased by 80e90% with the addition of 50% ash due to catalytic biochar formation. Consequently, nearly half the amount of wood is needed to produce the same amount of (ash-free) biochar. Mineral release was moderated in the composites compared to pure ash, demonstrated by a lower electric conductivity and % available K content (a factor of 2.5e4.4 lower than in wood ash). Furthermore, the % available chromium content, which is a key potentially toxic element in wood ash, decreased by a factor of 50e160. Soil application of biochar-ash composites decreases the risk of Cr toxicity, salinity stress and leaching of K in soil substantially compared to ash application. Biochar-ash composites are a novel product with vast unexplored potential for use in forestry and agriculture.",

		"abstract": "Wood ash recycling to forests may counteract nutrient losses caused by biomass harvest, since most nutrients except nitrogen are largely retained in the ash. Raw wood ash has an alkaline reaction with water and contains easily soluble as well as resistant compounds. Ash can be treated to ease handling and to avoid undesired effects on vegetation and leaching of nutrients. Forest ecosystems with different tree species and soils provide variable conditions for mineral dissolution with respect to pH, amount of organic ligands and humidity in the forest ﬂoor and the top soil. To study the effects of tree species and soil type on wood ash dissolution, granulated wood ash with particle size 2–4 mm was incubated in situ for 7 years in polyamide mesh bags. The bags were placed under the organic horizon of beech, oak, Norway spruce and Douglas-ﬁr on a nutrient poor soil (typic Haplorthod ) and a nutrient-rich soil (oxyaquic Hapludalf ) in Denmark. After 7 years of incubation, the weight loss of the wood ash granulates was 20% in both soil types. Nutrient losses determined by total element analysis were about 35% for calcium, magnesium and potassium and 19% for phosphorus, regardless of tree species or soil type. Incubation for 7 years could not demonstrate possible effects of tree species and soil type on the dissolution of granulated wood ash incubated in mesh bags. The missing effect of tree species and soil type is suggested to be an effect of the incubation method and the pre-treatment of the ash tested here using cement as a binder. Across this broad range in chemical weathering environment the granulated wood ash dissolved at a rather slow rate, suggesting that this ash will have a negligible impact on the soil environment.",

		"abstract": "Rehabilitation of skid trails, temporary roads, and log landings is required for many harvested sites in British Columbia; however, more information is needed regarding practical methods to return these access areas to productive forest. Lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud. var. latifolia Engelm.) seedlings (1 + 0) were planted into (i) fully rehabilitated landings (burn-pile debris and topsoil incorporated), (ii) tilled landings, and (iii) unprepared portions of the adjacent cutblock. After two seasons of growth in the field, seedlings planted on fully rehabilitated landings were 38% larger, more robust, and exhibited 44% greater absolute growth and 22% greater relative growth rates, than seedlings planted in the adjacent cutblock. Seedlings planted on tilled landings were 33% smaller, and exhibited absolute growth rates 38% less, and relative growth rates 18% less, than seedlings planted in the adjacent cutblock. Seedlings planted in the cutblock exhibited higher ectomycorrhizal colonization rates. Our results indicate that tillage alone was not sufficient to fully rehabilitate these landings, but that incorporation of recovered topsoil and burn-pile debris produced an excellent growth substrate. This method, using materials found on site, can prevent a significant loss of land regenerating to productive second-growth forest. Re´sume´ : En Colombie-Britannique, les sentiers de de´bardage, les chemins temporaires et les jete´es doivent eˆtre re´habilite´s dans plusieurs stations apre`s une coupe.

Our hypothesis is that different wood ashes and different proportions of them could have beneficial or detrimental effects depending on the applied dose. Materials and methods Dehydrogenase activity and soil oxygen consumption were used to evaluate the potential improvement of soil conditions through the application of two different wood ashes coming from industrial waste. Different ash proportions and time dependence have been used to make comparisons. The respiration curves obtained through a closed-jar incubation experiment were well fitted by a sigmoidal function, the derivative of which yields the time evolution of the consumption rate.\nResults and discussion The results indicate that the dehydrogenase activity and soil oxygen consumption are very sensitive to the presence of ashes in the soil, and the reached values of both are linked to the applied dose of them. In our research, soil oxygen consumption is time and rate dependent of ash application. The curves show that parameter was affected by the ashes in different way, raising the respiration rate, and stretching the biological activity period.\nConclusions Dehydrogenase activity and soil oxygen consumption are very sensitive to the presence of ashes and can",

		"abstract": "Land application is a cost-effective way of disposing of wood ash. However, high volume wood ash application tends to increase soil pH, solubilizing soil organic matter (SOM), and enhancing metal mobility. Column studies (1.5 Â 20 cm) were conducted to determine the leachability of Cu and Ni in an ash-amended soil. In the first study, deionized water was used to leach three columns: ash, ash mixed with topsoil, and ash mixed with topsoil overlying a spodic horizon. In the second study, humic acid (HA), fulvic acid (FA), and a mixture of humic and fulvic acids (HAFA) were used to leach ash columns. Leaching was conducted, one pore volume (PV) at a time, under unsaturated conditions. Leachate concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), Cl, Cu, and Ni, as well as pH were determined. Leachate pH ranged from f 10 to f 11 in the water- and acid-leached columns, respectively. In the ash-only columns, Cu leaching was in the form of soluble complexes with Cl. When wood ash was mixed with soil, Cu leached as soluble complexes with DOC at high pH ( f 10). Columns with a Bh horizon had 30% less leaching of Cu, possibly due to increased metal retention. Nickel leachability was not affected to the same extent as Cu. Organic acid-leached ash columns showed lower DOC, Cu, and Ni leaching, suggesting that these two metals and DOC were precipitating out with DOC at the high ionic strengths of these solutions ( > 0.3 mol dm À 3). Precipitation was greater in the more reactive FA-leached columns. This study shows the need to understand the system to which wood ash is applied to minimize potential harmful effects.

Treatments included wood ash, wood ash and lime admixtures, and lime amendments (ash amendment ranged from 0 to 20.17 and lime amendment from 0 to 4.06 g/kg soil on a dry weight basis). Treatments were compared for influence on soil pH, capacity to supply mineral nutrients to spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.

However, in admixtures of the two, plant dry weight increased with increasing rate of wood ash addition. Wood ash containing amendments had a greater positive effect on soil pH than did lime only treatments. Wood ash treatments increased soil EC, while lime only treatments had no effect. Losses of mineral elements decreased with successive leachings for treated and control soils. Calcium, K, and Na were leached from the soil in greater amounts from wood-ash treated soil. Leached Mg, however, was attributed to the soil and not to the amendment. Soil K and Ca at harvest increased linearly with increasing wood-ash rate, whereas Mg decreased linearly with decreasing lime rate.",

The relation between needle P concentration and acid phosphatase activity in the humus layer was studied during 1990-93 in a Norway spruce stand where the water and N and P supplies had been experimentally manipulated since 1988. Treatments included control (C), yearly application of ammonium sulphate (NS), N-free fertilizer (V), granulated wood ash (A), irrigation (I), drought (D) and water plus nutrients in an \"optimum\" combination (IF). We found indications of a feed-back mechanism for P, where low concentrations in the needles were associated with increased acid phosphatase activity in the humus layer. Acid phosphatase estimations made during moist soil conditions were much more informative than those made during dry conditions. We further argue that a site-specific \"base-line\" exists for acid phosphatase activity in the soil, mainly originating from enzymes immobilized in the field, but active in the assay. Increased phosphatase activity, above the base line, was generally found in the A, I and NS treatments, but in some cases also in C. Although P and N concentrations were significantly higher in the IF treatment as compared to the C and the D treatments, the P as fraction of N was 0.10 and thus balanced in all cases. In the A and I treatment P:N was around 0.09, while it was only 0.07 in the NS treatment, mainly due to high N concentrations. The latter treatment thus created an imbalanced situation where P additions most likely would have increased tree growth.",

		"abstract": "Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi are key players in N cycling in coniferous forests, and forest management such as application of wood ash can affect their functionality. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of wood ash application on ECM fungal mycelial production, capacity to retain N, diversity and community composition. In-growth mesh bags were installed in control and treated plots. After 6 months, 15N labeled ammonium and nitrate were applied into the mesh bags, and 24 h later extramatrical mycelium (EMM) was extracted and analyzed. Wood ash had no effects on EMM in-growth, N retention capacity, diversity or community composition. In contrast, there were signiﬁcant seasonal differences in the amount of EMM produced. These results demonstrate that applying up to 6 t haÀ1 of wood ash in this type of plantation forest is a safe management practice that does not increase N leaching or negatively affect ECM fungi.",

New regulations for conserving the environment have raised the costs of land®ll disposal and added to the diculties for acquiring new sites for disposal. Over a few decades a number of studies have been carried out on the utilization of wood ashes in agriculture and forestry as an alternative method for disposal. Because of their properties and their in¯uence on soil chemistry the utilization of wood ashes is particularly suited for the fertility management of tropical acid soils and forest soils. This review principally focuses on ash from the wood industry and power plants and considers its physical, chemical and mineralogical characteristics, its eect on soil properties, on the availability of nutrient elements and on the growth and chemical composition of crops and trees, as well as its impact on the environment.

		"abstract": "Burning biomass fuels generates large quantities of ash products which contain plant nutrients, such as Ca, Mg, P and K. To return these nutrients back to forest soil, biomass ash could be spread onto forest soil. Although biomass ash land application can decrease soil acidity and restore soil nutrient balance, its high alkalinity presents some challenges in terms of direct land application. The high alkalinity affects the leachability of various ash components and adversely affects ground vegetation. In this paper, we will show how CO2 can be used to effectively decrease ash alkalinity. The use of CO2 aqueous solubility and bicarbonate reactivity will be shown to be essential. From the study, we found that the rate of CO2 absorption depends heavily on the moisture content of the ash. Thus, the amount of water that needs to be added to the cooled ash products is important. The rate is also inﬂuenced by the CO2 partial pressure in the gas, up to almost 15% by volume. This concentration of CO2 is commonly found in treated ﬂue gas providing an opportunity for CO2 capture. The work also reports on the effect of carbonation on the leachability of ash nutrients.",

		"abstract": "Gasiﬁcation of biomass ultimately generates at least one solid byproduct in which the inorganic constituents of the biomass are concentrated. Given the potential for utilization, or issues with disposal, facile methods are needed for determining the compositions of the ﬂy ashes from recently-available gasiﬁer-based bioenergy systems. Proton induced x-ray emission spectroscopy (PIXE) and inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) were used to characterize the ﬂy ash recovered from a pilot-scale (25 kW) modular bioenergy system operated with wood chips as the feedstock. The composition of the ﬂy ash from the downdraft gasiﬁer showed some similarities to compositions reported for boiler wood ashes, apart from one half of the material being unburned carbon. Although ICP-AES showed greater sensitivity for the analysis of the ﬂy ash, especially for small amounts of heavy metal contaminants, PIXE proved to be a powerful analytical tool for screening of elements from sodium to uranium. Such broad spectrum screenings could prevent the inadvertent land application of unsuspected pollutant elements. Fly ashes from biomass gasiﬁcation appear to be suitable for use as ash-based fertilizers for forest lands; however, combustion to remove unburned carbon may be advisable.",

In this study, total and leachable concentrations of 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were determined in four ash samples and one green liquor sludge. The ash sample with the highest carbon content also contained high levels of PAHs; three of the ash samples had total concentrations exceeding the limit permitted by the Swedish Forest Agency for recycling to forest soils. The leachable concentrations were higher for the nonstabilized samples; this was probably due to colloid-facilitated transport of the contaminants in these samples. However, the leachable concentrations were overall relatively low in all the samples studied. The amounts of PAHs introduced to forest soils by additions of stabilized, recyclable ash products will be determined primarily by the rate of weathering of the ash particles and the total concentration of contaminants.",

The sites were chosen to represent the Swedish peatlands that are most suitable for ash fertilization, with respect to stand growth response. The ﬂuxes of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) from the forest ﬂoor, measured using opaque static chambers, were monitored at both sites during 2004 and 2005 and at one of the sites during the period 1 October 2007–1 October 2008. No signiﬁcant (p N 0.05) changes in forest ﬂoor greenhouse gas exchange were detected. The annual emissions of CO2 from the sites varied between 6.4 and 15.4 tonnes ha−1, while the CH4 ﬂuxes varied between 1.9 and 12.5 kg ha−1. The emissions of N2O were negligible. Ash fertilization increased soil pH at a depth of 0–0.05 m by up to 0.9 units (p b 0.01) at one site, 5 years after application, and by 0.4 units (p b 0.05) at the other site, 4 years after application. Over the ﬁrst 5 years after fertilization, the mean annual tree stand basal area increment was signiﬁcantly larger (p b 0.05) at the highest ash dose plots compared with control plots (0.64 m2 ha− 1 year− 1 and 0.52 m2 ha− 1 year− 1, respectively). The stand biomass, which was calculated using tree biomass functions, was not signiﬁcantly affected by the ash treatment. The groundwater levels during the 2008 growing season were lower in the high ash dose plots than in the corresponding control plots (p b 0.05), indicating increased evapotranspiration as a result of increased tree growth. The larger basal area increment and the lowered groundwater levels in the high ash dose plots suggest that fertilization promoted tree growth, while not affecting greenhouse gas emissions.",

In this contribution we present a whole-systems analysis of the BECCS value chain associated with cultivation, harvesting, transport and conversion in dedicated biomass power stations in conjunction with CCS, of a range of biomass resources – both dedicated energy crops (miscanthus, switchgrass, short rotation coppice willow), and agricultural residues (wheat straw). We explicitly consider the implications of sourcing the biomass from different regions, climates and land types. The water, carbon and energy footprints of each value chain were calculated, and their impact on the overall system water, carbon and power efficiencies was evaluated. An extensive literature review was performed and a statistical analysis of the available data is presented. In order to describe the dynamic greenhouse gas balance of such a system, a yearly accounting of the emissions was performed over the lifetime of a BECCS facility, and the carbon “breakeven time” and lifetime net CO\n              2\n              removal from the atmosphere were determined. The effects of direct and indirect land use change were included, and were found to be a key determinant of the viability of a BECCS project. Overall we conclude that, depending on the conditions of its deployment, BECCS could lead to both carbon positive and negative results. The total quantity of CO\n              2\n              removed from the atmosphere over the project lifetime and the carbon breakeven time were observed to be highly case specific. This has profound implications for the policy frameworks required to incentivise and regulate the widespread deployment of BECCS technology. The results of a sensitivity analysis on the model combined with the investigation of alternate supply chain scenarios elucidated key levers to improve the sustainability of BECCS: (1) measuring and limiting the impacts of direct and indirect land use change, (2) using carbon neutral power and organic fertilizer, (3) minimising biomass transport, and prioritising sea over road transport, (4) maximising the use of carbon negative fuels, and (5) exploiting alternative biomass processing options,\n              e.g.\n              , natural drying or torrefaction. A key conclusion is that, regardless of the biomass and region studied, the sustainability of BECCS relies heavily on intelligent management of the supply chain.",

Four blocks were installed in each forest type containing the following treatments: control, N  Ca  Mg  K  P  S (complete), wood-®red boiler ash (ash), N  wood-®red boiler ash N  ash, and two rates of paper mill sludge (sludge and 2Â sludge). The northern hardwood forests had three additional treatments: N, Ca  Mg  K (base cations), and N  Ca  Mg  K (N  base cations). Fertilizer treatments were designed to provide N at a rate of 100 kg haÀ1. Other nutrients were applied in proportion to N so that N, P, K, S, Mg, and Ca were applied at a ratio of 100:50:33:9:5:4, respectively. Total ANPP was not signi®cantly different among treatments for the maple stands, but plots treated with wood ash were 10% greater than controls. ANPP was greater in 1998 and 1999 for aspen plots receiving N  ash, but results were only statistically signi®cant p  0:013 in 1999. Basal area differed by 40±60% among experimental plots within any given block and was positively correlated to wood increment. Wood increment, adjusted for basal area, did not differ signi®cantly among treatments for the aspen stands, but the N  ash treatment was 30% greater than the control. A two-way factorial comparison indicated that ash had a signi®cant p  0:024 positive effect on wood increment and N had a signi®cant p  0:044 negative effect on wood increment for the maple stands. Tree growth was not correlated to foliar nutrient concentrations, but ratios of K to other elements (K:Ca, K:Mg, K:N, and K:P) were highest, on average, for wood ash plots. These differences were not statistically signi®cant with the exception of K:N for the aspen stands and K:Ca for the maple stands. We did not observe any bene®cial effects of paper mill sludge on forest growth, but there was some evidence that wood ash increased annual wood production.",

		"abstract": "Urea used to fertilize acid forest soils can be lost by NH3 volatilization. The objective of this research was to examine, in the laboratory, the impact of CaCl2, applied with urea, on NH, losses from (i) forest floor litter (FFL) alone, (ii) FFL with CaCO3, and (iii) wood ash (WA) amended FFL. Ammonia loss, urease activity, and N availability were measured as functions of the CaCl2 treatments. Low NH3 loss occurred during the first 10 d after application of urea; however, NH3 loss increased in the 10 d after a second urea application. Application of CaCO3 or WA to the FFL prior to urea fertilization caused slightly faster NH3 losses than observed from FFL alone. Reuse of FFL with CaCO3 (after extensive leaching) also resulted in very rapid NH3 loss. When CaCl2 was added with urea, however, at a molar ratio of 0.5 or 1.0, there were negligible NH3 losses from either unamended FFL or FFL with CaCO3. Low urease activity was detected in unamended FFL after urea application (16 °C). Higher urease activity was measured in FFL after treatment with a 0.25 molar ratio of CaCl2/urea (1:4 Ca/urea), but NH, losses in the presence of CaQ2 were extremely low or nondetectable. Urease activity in all WA treatments was high. Based on the amount of KC1extractable N (NH4, urea) and volatilized NH3, it appeared that N was rapidly immobilized at 0.5 and 1.0 Ca/urea in both unamended FFL and FFL amended with CaCO3. Recovery of nrea-N was complete in all of the WA treatments and in the urea and 0.25 molar ratio of CaCl2 + urea in FFL and FFL + CaCO3. Extractable N and volatile NH3 from the 0.5 and 1.0 soluble Ca/urea treatments (FFL and FFL with CaCO3) accounted for less than one-half of the N applied. It was hypothesized that CaCl2 at molar ratios > 0.5 with respect to urea stimulated biological immobilization of NH4.",

The volume of the growing stock was more than 70 m 3 ha -1 for the highest dose while control plots produced less than 15 m3ha -l. Vegetation characteristics changed following ash treatments with high ash doses favouring grasses and low ash doses promoting mosses. Some major changes in soil and foliar nutrient concentrations were evident due to ash fertilization. K and B, however, were clearly the most limiting nutrients that could be cycled where high doses of ash were used. This was particularly the case with a dose of 20 Mg ha -1. Decomposition of the topsoil was at its highest on plots with ash doses of 5 and 10 Mg h a - 1 ash and at its lowest when the dose was 2 Mg ha ~. This was partly due to differences in the C/N ratio of the soil. All decomposition parameters indicated a high degree of humification in the topsoil. High N content (of organic material), low C/N in the soil and optimum levels of foliar N concentrations suggested sufficient N mineralization for tree growth to have occurred in the soil.",

Therefore, in this study we evaluated the effects of pelletized ashes on the chemical and microbiological properties of four soils representative for the central Alps [rendzic Leptosol (L), ﬁbric Histosol (H), haplic Podzol (P), and dystric Cambisol (Cm)] in a microcosm trial during 22 weeks.

		"abstract": "Water quality of the Big Thompson River in the Front Range of Colorado was studied for 2 years following a high-elevation wildﬁre that started in October 2012 and burned 15% of the watershed. A combination of ﬁxed-interval sampling and continuous water-quality monitors was used to examine the timing and magnitude of water-quality changes caused by the wildﬁre. Preﬁre water quality was well characterized because the site has been monitored at least monthly since the early 2000s. Major ions and nitrate showed the largest changes in concentrations; major ion increases were greatest in the ﬁrst postﬁre snowmelt period, but nitrate increases were greatest in the second snowmelt period. The delay in nitrate release until the second snowmelt season likely reﬂected a combination of factors including ﬁre timing, hydrologic regime, and rates of nitrogen transformations. Despite the small size of the ﬁre, annual yields of dissolved constituents from the watershed increased 20–52% in the ﬁrst 2 years following the ﬁre. Turbidity data from the continuous sensor indicated high-intensity summer rain storms had a much greater effect on sediment transport compared to snowmelt. High-frequency sensor data also revealed that weekly sampling missed the concentration peak during snowmelt and short-duration spikes during rain events, underscoring the challenge of characterizing postﬁre water-quality response with ﬁxed-interval sampling.

Physicochemical measurements (pH, organic matter content, extractable and total C content, NH~- and total N content, cation-exchange capacity, base saturation) showed similarity between the fire-treated plots and those treated with the lowest dose of wood ash (1000 kg ha-l). The ash application did not change the level of microbial biomass C or fungal ergosterol when compared to the control, being around 7500 and 350 gg g-1 organic matter for the biomass C and ergosterol, respectively9 The fire treatment lowered the values of both biomass measurements to about half that of the control values9 The fire treatment caused a sevenfold fall in the respiration rate of fieldmoist soil to 1.8 ~tl h - 1g - ~ organic matter compared to the values of the control or ash treatments. However, in the same soils adjusted to a water-holding capacity of 60%, the differences between the fire treatment and the control were diminished, and the ash-fertilized plots were characterized by a higher respiration rate compared to the control plots. The glucose-induced respiration reacted in the same way as the water-adjusted soil respiration. The metabolic quotient, qCO2, gradually increased from the control level with increasing applications of ash, reaching a maximum in the fire treatment. Nitrification was not observed in the treatment plots.",

To investigate the combined and separated effects of Cd and ash on the forest humus microflora, pumice or wood ash, spiked with a water-soluble (CdCl2) or -insoluble (CdO) form of Cd at three levels (0, 400 and 1000 mg kg31), were applied at a fertilization level of 5000 kg ha31 in a laboratory microcosm study. The trial consisted of 60 microcosms (five replications per treatment), which were incubated in darkness at +20³C and a constant relative air humidity of 60%. After two months the humus in the microcosms was sampled. Analyses of CO2 evolution to measure the overall microbial activity and of phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) pattern to measure microbial community structure were performed. The substrate-use patterns of Biolog EcoPlates were analyzed as a measure of bacterial functionality. Finally the bacterial 3H-thymidine incorporation in the presence of different concentrations of Cd and the number of colony forming units (cfu) of bacteria on nutrient agar in the presence of 0, 5 and 20 mg Cd l31 agar were applied to measure Cd tolerance. The use of pumice (pH of humus under the pumice 4.0) did not induce any changes in the above variables compared to two untreated microcosms (humus pH 3.9). Pumice was therefore used to distribute the Cd evenly over the humus surface in order to estimate the possible effect of Cd without ash (pH of humus under the ash 7.0). The application of ash increased the microbial activity, changed the PLFA and substrate-use patterns and increased cfu compared to the humus under pumice. The form and level of Cd in the ash had no further effect on this result. In the humus under pumice the level, but not the form of Cd decreased the microbial activity and changed the PLFA pattern compared to the unspiked pumice. None of the treatments induced bacterial tolerance to Cd. Ash thus protected the humus microflora from the harmful effects of Cd. ß 2000 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

		"abstract": "The effects of lime and wood-ash on the microbial community structure were evaluated by analyzing the phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) composition of soils from two areas in the south of Sweden. A pine forest was amended with lime or ash at two concentrations, and a spice forest was limed at one concentration. The treatments were carried out S-6 years before sampling and raised the pH from approx. 4.0 to values between 4.8 and 7.0. At both sites there was a difference in the PLFA composition between the treated plots and the controls. The changes found were similar at both sites and correlated to the pH changes. No difference was found between limed plots and those treated with wood-ash. The methylbranched fatty acids i15:0, i16:O and lOMe16:0, the monounsaturated fatty acids 16: lo7t and 18: 1~9, the cyclopropane fatty acid cyl9:0, and the saturated fatty acid 20:0 were more abundant in the control plots. In the plots with the highest pH there was a three-fold increase in the fatty acid 16: 105. An increase was also found for the fatty acids i14:0, 16:lw9, 16: lw7c, cyl7:0, 18:107 and lOMe18:O.No effecton 18:2w6 was found. The changes in PLFA pattern indicated that the increased pH caused a shift in the bacterial community to more Gram-negative and fewer Gram-positive bacteria, while the amount of fungi was unaffected. The increase in lOMe18:0 in limed soils indicated an increase in actinomycetes.",

		"abstract": "In this paper, a screening-level life cycle assessment (LCA) approach is used to compare the potential environmental benefits and tradeoffs of different management options for wood ash, namely, agricultural land application, forest soil amendment, use in forest roads, use in concrete and mortar, and landfilling. Uncertainty analyses are used to evaluate the generalizability of the results obtained. Although decisions regarding the selection of a beneficial use option are site-specific and depend on available local markets and wood ash characteristics, this study shows that it is possible to draw a few general conclusions from the application of LCA. All beneficial use (BU) options showed lower environmental indicator scores than those associated with landfilling, in addition to net potential environmental benefits. From an environmental perspective, results suggest that, only in a few situations, beneficially using wood ash might not produce potential net environmental benefits but would still be preferred over landfilling, and in a very few cases, landfilling would be preferred over a BU option. For instance, net environmental benefits may be compromised if wood ash needs to be transported over long distances before it can be beneficially used. Out of the four BU options evaluated, the use of wood ash in concrete to replace Portland cement showed the greatest potential environmental benefits. However, the application of wood ash on agricultural or forest land showed greater environmental benefits than the use in concrete in cases where both its liming and fertilizing potentials are assumed to be achieved at the same time.",

		"abstract": "A ﬁeld experiment to test various management practices of sustainable forestry was conducted in a Swiss spruce forest for two growing seasons. Treatments were a control (C), yearly application of 4000 kg ha−1 wood ash (A), daily irrigation with a steady state fertilisation as ‘optimal nutrition‘ (F) and irrigation with a water control (W). Samples were taken on a 5 × 5 m grid once a year with a soil corer to determine ﬁne root biomass (≤ 2 mm) and soil pH of the topsoil. A subset of the ﬁne root samples was further analysed for its nutrient composition by CN and ICP-AES analyses. The dynamics of root growth were observed with the aid of ingrowth-cores after 1, 1.5, and 2 years of treatment and the growth pattern was analysed in terms of biomass, tips, forks, length and root diameter of the samples. The A, F and also the W treatment resulted in a signiﬁcant increase of soil pH in the topsoil. The ﬁne root density increased over the two growing seasons, irrespective of the treatment. The root growth was only slightly different between the treatments with a initially faster growth under the A treatment. The W treatment reduced the number of root tips and forks, and the root length, while the A treatment increased the number of root tips, forks and the root length, but reduced the diameter. The differences between the three harvesting times (March 1999, October 1999, March 2000) of the ingrowth-cores stressed seasonal differences in root growth and the development of quasi ‘steady state’ root dynamics. The root turnover was not changed by the treatments. The elements in the ﬁne roots were strongly affected by the treatments A and F and sometimes by W. Fine root N increased with the F treatment, while C concentrations decreased under the A, F and W treatments. The Ca and Mg concentrations were strongly enhanced by A but also by the F treatment. The K and P concentrations in the ﬁne roots were improved by all three applications. Due to the pH increase Al, Fe and Mn concentrations in the ﬁne roots were decreased by the A and F treatments. S and Zn concentrations showed inconsistent changes over the growing seasons. The results of this study were comparable with those of other studies in Europe and conﬁrm the abilities of the ﬁne roots as indicators of forest nutrition, to some extent more sensitive than the commonly used foliar analysis.",

It was also found at this site that the total Al and the inorganic Al concentrations decreased with dolomite treatment. The Ca, Mg, DOC, Fe, SO24− and Cl− concentrations, mainly in the topsoil, were found to be higher at both sites, following dolomite treatment; Ca and Mg concentrations were 2–8 times higher (<820 µM) than in controls (<70 µM). Wood ash was found to have less impact. The PO4 concentration in the O2 horizon at Hasslöv decreased due to dolomite-treatment.

Treatments were loose and pelleted ash application (11 Mg ha-1), alone or combined with N fertilizer, and a control treatment. Nutrient leaching and soil chemical and biological properties were periodically evaluated for a 30-month period. Wood ash increased leaching of base cations (Ca, Mg, Na and K) and P, mainly at the beginning of the study. The effect was more pronounced for the loose formulation. As a consequence, a positive effect on soil nutrient availability (exchangeable base cations and extractable P) and soil acidity reduction was observed for the loose formulation in the 0–10-cm soil layer. Carbon and N dynamics were only affected when ash was applied with N fertilizer, which enhanced CO2 ﬂux during the study period.",

In the forest ﬂoor, litter (OL), fragmented (OF), and humic (OH) horizons with average thickness of 1.5, 2, and 4 cm, respectively, could be distinguished. Three replicates of two wood ash treatments (3 and 6 t¨ ha´1) and a control were established in the autumn of 2012. Soil samples from OL, OF, OH and A-horizon were taken 0.5, 1, 6 and 12 months after the WA application. In soil samples chemical (pH, C and N content, C:N ratio, concentration of exchangeable Ca, Mg and K) and microbial properties (basal respiration, catalase activity, structure of microbial community based on BIOLOG assay) were determined. Our results showed that the changes in microbial and chemical properties do not occur simultaneously in particular horizons. WA application in autumn lead to a signiﬁcant increase in pH, base cation concentration, and distinct losses in C and N content in the OL layer in the ﬁrst month; however, at the beginning of the vegetation period, the most pronounced effect of WA was observed in OF and especially OH horizons; no changes were found in the A-horizon. Different properties of particular forest ﬂoor horizons led to a vertical stratiﬁcation of the microbial community. Each forest ﬂoor horizon had particular properties, leading to a vertical stratiﬁcation of the microbial community; deeper horizons had more homogenous functional groups.",

The objective of this study was to determine the impacts of a single application of sludge/ash at site preparation on loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) survival and growth. In the summer of 2002, a 2:1 sludge/ash mixture from a Kraft mill was mixed into beds during site preparation at three levels: 0, 39, and 77 tons per acre. Loblolly pine was planted in February 2004, followed by N fertilization at two levels (0 and 125 pounds per acre) in May. First-year measurements of survival (SURV), ground line diameter (GLD), total height (HT), and height to live crown (HTLC) were taken in February 2004. HT and HTLC were used to calculate vertical crown length (VCL). All sludge/ash treated plots showed greater HT and VCL than control (CTL) plots. Results showed greater HT and VCL in trees receiving 39 tons per acre with no fertilization and those receiving 77 tons per acre with fertilization. GLD was signiﬁcantly greater for trees receiving 77 tons per acre with fertilization. Second year results show similar results for HT but not for VCL or GLD. VCL showed less stratiﬁcation by the second year, and GLD had no signiﬁcant differences. There was no difference in SURV between treatments for either year. The sludge/ash mixture showed HT growth beneﬁt. Operational costs are somewhat prohibitive without more efﬁcient methods of transport and application.",

		"abstract": "Intensive harvesting of forest residues for energy production may lead to the depletion of organic matter and mineral nutrients in the forest floor. In order to restore nutrient content wood ash has been suggested as a fertiliser. Ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi are involved in the nutrient uptake of forest trees and this study investigates the influence of intensive harvesting and wood ash fertilisation on the external EM mycelium in forest soil. Nylon mesh bags filled with sand were buried in September 1997 in field plots which had or had not been intensively harvested. The effect of wood ash on the production of external EM mycelium was studied in mesh bags amended with wood ash. Mesh bags were retrieved in May and October 1998. The relative amount of fungal mycelia in the mesh bags was estimated with phospholipid fatty acid analysis. The fungi colonising the mesh bags were mainly ( s 90%) ectomycorrhizal. Fungal biomass in the mesh bags was low in the spring but high in the autumn. No significant effect on EM fungal biomass was observed in the mesh bags collected from intensively harvested plots compared with those from control plots, but wood ash amendment resulted in 2.4 times more EM fungal biomass (P 6 0.05). The effect of external EM mycelium on the dissolution of wood ash was studied in mesh bags filled with wood ash, using mesh bags buried in soil isolated from roots as EM-free controls. The external EM mycelium had no effect on the dissolution rate of the wood ash. 80% of the potassium was lost from the wood ash within a month, whereas no phosphorus was lost during the experimental period (up to 13 months). ß 2001 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

The experiment was conducted on 30 Â 30 m2 plots, each treatment being replicated four times. Soil animals were sampled throughout the growing season in the third year after the treatments. As a rule, numbers of soil animals increased during the study period. Numbers of the only enchytraeid worm species found at the study site, Cognettia sphagnetorum, were lower in the plots with higher ash level and plots which have been burned. In the plots having these treatments, enchytraeid populations increased during the study period. Total numbers of microarthropods were decreased in the plots which had received the most drastic treatments: the higher ash level and burning. Only ®ve species of collembolas responded signi®cantly to these treatments. Multivariate analyses showed, however, signi®cant changes in the collembola community structure of all the treatments. Overall, soil fauna seemed to be quite resistant and resilient against unpredictable disturbances, like ash fertilisation and prescribed burning, the thick humus layer being a major buffer against chemical and physical changes. # 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

The aim of the study was to investigate the eﬀect of ash application at doses of 0, 3, 4.5 and 6 Mg ha−1 with three replicates on soil and soil solution chemical properties in a mature Norway spruce plantation in Denmark from 2014 to 2017. Un-replicated extreme scenarios of 15 and 30 Mg ha−1 were included. Soil solution from 15 to 60 cm depth were sampled each month over a period of 2 years and 9 months after ash application and soil samples were obtained after 2.5 years. The ﬂuxes of nutrients and heavy metals through the soil were calculated based on water ﬂuxes modelled with CoupModel. Geochemical modelling was applied on selected soil solution data to investigate changes in heavy metal complexation and mobility. Application of ash to forest soil increased both soil pH and nutrient concentrations in the O-horizon but not in the mineral soil. No changes were detected in the soil solution chemistry or in the speciation of heavy metal at doses ranging up to 30 Mg ha−1, and there was therefore no change in the mobility of metals caused by ash application. The un-replicated extreme scenario suggested that the O-horizon concentration of Cd, Co, Cr, Cu and Zn could increase proportionally with increasing ash application dose, while no indications of changes in the mineral soil below 5 cm could be seen. Among the experimentally replicated treatments, only the Cd concentration at dose 6 Mg ha−1 exceeded the Danish legislation limits, in the O-horizon of 0.5 ppm.",

The aim of this study was therefore to investigate micro vertical changes in soil pH and base cations over time after application of wood ash on forest soil. A column experiment with repacked O- and A-horizon forest soil was constructed and treatments of 0, 3 and 9 t wood ash ha−1 were applied on top of the soil in replicates of three. Soil cores were extracted from the columns monthly over one year for pH micro sensor measurements of O- and A-horizon (0–5 cm soil depth) and at four occasions (62, 152, 278 and 363 days after treatment) additional soil cores were extracted for base cation analysis. Results showed that ash application creates strong pH gradients ranging from pH 11 to 4.5 within the top 1–1.5 cm of the soil, with the highest variation within the ﬁrst 50 days after application. Application of ash increases the nutrient availability. If micro scale variation is not considered, mean pH values can be a misleading indicator for the extreme conditions that can exists in the top part of the soil after ash application.",

		"abstract": "In the future, it may become common practice in Swedish forestry to recycle wood-ash, a waste product of the combustion of bio-fuel. As a consequence of the Chernobyl radioactive fallout in 1986, large areas of central Sweden were contaminated. Application of recycled wood-ash, originating from contaminated areas, to a previously uncontaminated forest, risks an increase in the concentration of radioactive 137Cs. We measured 137Cs radioactivity in different parts of coniferous forests in seven ﬁeld experiments. Measurements of radioactivity were made 5᎐8 years after an application of wood-ash equivalent to 3000 kg hay1. The sites, in a north᎐south transect across Sweden, have a background radioactivity ranging from 0 to 40 kBq my2, the higher levels are mainly a result of the Chernobyl fall-out. Depending on its origin, the radioactivity of the applied wood-ash ranged from 0.0 to 4.8 kBq kgy1, corresponding to 0.0᎐1.44 kBq my2. In autumn 1999, samples were taken from the soil, ﬁeld vegetation, needles and twigs and the levels of 137Cs determined. In addition, soil samples were analysed for extractable K. The highest 137Cs concentration was found in the soil. At six of the seven sites there were no statistically signiﬁcant effects of wood-ash application on 137Cs activity. This was despite the fact that the wood-ash had, in one case, added the same amount of radioactivity as the background. However, at one site with intermediate 137Cs deposition Ž10᎐20 kBq my2 ., there was a statistically signiﬁcant decrease in 137Cs radioactivity in the soil, needles and twigs from the plots treated with wood-ash. The decrease in radioactivity was partly due to the fact that one of the main constituents of wood-ash is K, which is antagonistic to 137Cs. Based on our results, it appears that application of wood-ash containing 137Cs does not necessarily increase the 137Cs radioactivity in plants and soil. However, some of the observed effects could be a result of the low number of replicates used in this study. ᮊ 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

Chemical composition, leaching and dissolution characteristics were determined for the Draken wood ash, the dolomite used in granule manufacturing and the final granule product. The heavy metal concentrations in fly ash were within the limit values recommended by the Swedish National Board of Forestry for ash recycling, except for Cd and As levels which occasionally exceeded the limit values. The Ca, Mn and P levels were too low for nutrient recycling at the time. Adding dolomite insures that the levels of the important nutrients Ca and Mg are sufficient in the granules. After 7 months in the field, about 60 % of Na and K was leached out from granules. Between 20 and 60 % of trace elements Mo, Sc, V, Y and Zr were leached out after 7 months. The release of Ca and Mg was low, 1±5 % during 7 months.",

Propionate (7–268 µM) and malonate (2–34 µM) were the LMWOAs found in the highest concentrations at Hasslöv. Two other LMWOAs dominated at Horröd, namely citrate (18–64 µM) and fumarate (5–31 µM). The differences in concentration of most of the determined LMWOAs at Hasslöv were signiﬁcantly increased due to treatment. The LMWOAs comprised between 1.1–6.3% of the DOC at Hasslöv and 4.5–17.6% at Horröd. At Hasslöv normally 3–10% of the total acidity (TA) was due to LMWOAs and the average speciﬁc buffer capacity was 74 ± 22 mmol mol−1C. The total DOC concentration in the mor layer solution was ∼16 mM for the dolomite treated plots compared to ∼10 mM at the untreated plot. A major part of the increase in DOC at the treated plots apparently had a hydrophobic character and was of high molecular weight corresponding to 3–10 kDa.

We studied the effects of fertilization on the establishment of vegetation on a cut-away peatland in Finland. Six treatments of different quantities and mixtures of wood ash, peat ash, biotite, or forest P–K fertilizer were replicated in three plots. Although all the fertilizers accelerated the revegetation of a cut-away peatland significantly, ash-based fertilizers had the greatest and most immediate impact on the formation of vegetation. Ash fertilizers especially increased the coverage of small fire-loving moss species such as Ceratodon purpureus (Hedw.) Brid., Funaria hygrometrica Hedw., and Leptobryum pyriforme (Hedw.) Wils. in the early stages of the succession. Furthermore, the succeeding coverage of vascular plants improves nutritional conditions through the rapid accumulation and decomposition of plant-derived litter. The rapid formation of ground vegetation on bare peat surface after ash fertilizer application indicated that wood and peat ash are suitable for mined peatlands. This being the case, peat and wood ash should be regarded more as a recyclable constituent rather than as waste in afforestation of cut-away peatlands.",

We studied the effect of fertilization and afforestation methods on the early establishment of downy birch (Betula pubescens Ehrh.) seedlings on a cut-away peatland. Six treatments of peat-ash, wood-ash, biotite, or PK-fertilizer were replicated in three blocks in different mixtures corresponding to 50 kg/ha of phosphorous. Birch seeds were sown in randomized halves of split plots, while other halves were naturally afforested. Natural afforestation was equal to sowing in terms of seedling amounts due to closeness of surrounding birch stands with abundant seed crops. After the ﬁrst growing season the greatest quantities and dominant heights of birch seedlings appeared on the ash-fertilized plots, whereas on the unfertilized areas both the establishment and growth of seedlings was very poor. On the other hand, the quantity of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) seedlings was more than three times higher on the unfertilized areas compared to the ash-fertilized areas. The differences between the fertilized and the unfertilized areas accentuated during the four observation years. Our results support regular use of ash-fertilizers for the afforestation of cut-away peatlands instead of the ash being deposited as a waste in landﬁlls.",

		"abstract": "Afforestation is one of the most popular after-use options of cut-away peatlands in Scandinavia since it has both economic and aesthetic values and therefore the interest concerning the carbon stock often focuses on tree stands. Consequently, ground vegetation is readily disregarded in the present calculations of the climatic impact of afforestation. However, at the early stages of afforestation vigorous ground vegetation may have a major role in carbon sequestration. The biomass and C stock of ground vegetation and young tree seedlings were examined on an ash-fertilized and afforested cut-away peatland. Six treatments of different mixtures and quantities of wood-ash, peat-ash, biotite or Forest PK-fertilizer were replicated in three plots. Betula pubescens Ehrh. seeds were sown on randomized halves of split plots while the other halves were left unsown. The plant biomass was harvested four growing seasons after the treatments. The live above-ground biomass of ground vegetation on a cut-away peatland was up to two times that of tree seedlings. Furthermore, the below-ground biomass of ground vegetation and tree seedlings was equal to the above-ground biomass, or even greater. In particular, the biomass of mosses multiplied on ash-based fertilized areas compared to the Forest PK-fertilized areas. Our study proved that at the early stages of afforestation ground vegetation was even more important in biomass production and C stock than tree seedlings. Consequently, our results suggest that ground vegetation biomass should also be considered when the climatic impact of afforestation of cut-away peatlands is being calculated.",

		"abstract": "In Finland, recycling of wood-ash as a fertilizer has been widely studied in recent decades in peatlands drained for forestry. Wood-ash is reported to promote tree growth without any signiﬁcant negative impacts on the environment and could, therefore, be a suitable option on cut-away peatlands, which are estimated to increase by 30,000 ha over the next ten years. However, the environmental effects of ashfertilization on cut-away peatlands or on ground vegetation are not well known. We studied the effects of wood- and peat-ash application on the nutrient content in soil and plants and on the heavy metal content in the vegetation of a cut-away peatland. Six treatments of different quantities and mixtures of wood-ash, peat-ash, biotite, or Forest PK-fertilizer were replicated in three plots. Both wood- and peat-ash fertilization ensured an adequate level of nutrients for the early establishment and growth of ground vegetation and birch seedlings in a cut-away peatland. Dense pioneer moss cover was important in trapping the heavy metals, such as cadmium, which are present in the ash. Ground vegetation of mosses and herbaceous plants also had a major role in the retention of the nutrients that could otherwise have leached from the open cut-away peatland area during the early stages of afforestation. Both wood- and peat-ash proved to be suitable for the initial fertilization of afforested cut-away peatlands, but in order to guarantee a sufﬁcient long-term potassium supply for tree growth, an application of biotite with the peat-ash is recommended.",

		"abstract": "The increasing use of wood fuels to replace fossil fuels in energy and heat production results in increasing amounts of waste in the form of ash. Since wood ash contains nutrients that trees need in the right proportions, except for N, it is a potentially excellent forest fertiliser. However, any harmful elements, e.g., heavy metals are also concentrated in the ash, which has raised concern about possible adverse effects that ash fertilisation could induce in the environment. A considerable body of new results has been published on ash fertilisation impacts on, e.g., heavy metal concentrations in berries and mushrooms, ground vegetation, soil microbial processes, greenhouse gas emissions and watercourses. In this review, we synthesise this information to map the environmental beneﬁts and risks related to ash fertilisation. We pay special attention to peatland forests, N-rich ecosystems where ash may induce considerable increases in timber production, but for which a thorough evaluation of environmental impacts has been lacking. The longest monitoring periods currently span more than ﬁve decades. In well-targeted sites, ash increases tree production and/or reduces soil acidity for decades. No enrichment of heavy metals in the food webs or leaching of heavy metals to watercourses has been reported. CO2 emissions increase in the longer term (10–50 years), especially from N-rich peat soils. Also, changes in plant community may be so extensive that ash application cannot be recommended where conservation of the original vegetation is required. Immobilisation of heavy metals in soil depends on the neutralising effect of ash on soil acidity. The most crucial question that remains to be answered is how long this effect lasts, and what happens thereafter. Future research should investigate further whether heavy metals may accumulate in plant roots, even if above-ground parts remain unaffected. Finally, the duration of the impact of ash fertilisation on the nutrition of peatland trees, as well as optimal schedules of repeated fertilisations for different rotations, still need to be veriﬁed.",

One of the stands was growing on a peatland site (Muhos) and the other on a mineral soil site (Juuka). The stands were clear-cut and fertilization experiments were laid out with several treatments. At Muhos, the treatments included nitrogen fertilisation with different amounts of wood ash and an unfertilized control. At Juuka, the treatments included nitrogen fertilisation either with ash or with PK, and ash and PK treatments alone and an unfertilized control. The sprouts at Muhos were grown for 17 years and at Juuka for 20 years. At Juuka the stand was clear-cut second time at the age of 20 years and grown for 8 years. The stands were measured several times and foliar samples were taken twice during the study period. Clear-cutting increased stem number manifold. The stand density of new coppiced forests after the clear-cutting decreased from 67 000–89 000 stems ha–1 at the age of 3–6 years to 10 000–12 000 stems ha–1 at the age of 17–20 years.

The aims were to compare ash types (wood, peat and coal ash), study the effects of ash treatment (pelletization), compare ash fertilization with commercial fertilizers, and to study the interaction between ash fertilization and weed control. Foliar samples were collected 1–3 years and 7–8 years after fertilization. In the unfertilized plots, the foliar nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations were fairly high, while those of potassium were low in all the experiments. The boron levels were low in three out of the four experiments. Application of either loose or pelletized wood ash, as well as of commercial fertilizers, increased foliar potassium and boron concentrations, and thus successfully remedied the existing nutrient imbalances and deﬁciencies. Since phosphorus deﬁciencies are rarely encountered on ﬁeld afforestation sites, poorquality wood ash with low phosphorus concentration could be used. Peat ash containing phosphorus, but only small amounts of potassium and boron, was not found to be very suitable for soil amelioration in connection with ﬁeld afforestation. Coal ash, containing only small amounts of potassium, was a good source of boron for pine even when used in small amounts, and thus it can be used in cases where boron deﬁciencies alone are encountered. Wood ash signiﬁcantly increased the height growth of Scots pines in two of the experiments, but peat ash and coal ash had no statistically signiﬁcant effect. Wood ash increased the number of healthy seedlings. Vegetation control decreased seedling mortality by 24%, increased the growth of pine and decreased the proportion of trees damaged by elk and by deciduous trees.",

Dense, naturally regenerated 16-year-old birch stands were cut down, fertilized with either wood ash (P 108 and K 339 kg ha–1) or PK fertilizer (P 50 and K 95 kg ha–1) or left unfertilized. The biomass production of the coppiced stands and one uncut stand was monitored for a period of 21 years. Soil nutrient and foliar nutrient concentrations were analyzed several times during the study period. Ash fertilization supplied more nutrients than PK fertilization and increased the soil nutrient amounts more. The foliar phosphorus concentration of birch on control plots indicated a severe phosphorus deficiency which was removed by PK and ash fertilization. Fertilization did not increase nutrient concentrations of the stem (wood + bark) nor the amount of nutrients bound in the biomass. Two energy wood rotations (16+21 years) produced 124–158 Mg ha–1 of leafless, above-ground biomass altogether corresponding to 61–78 Mg ha–1 of carbon. The highest biomass yield was achieved with a rotation of 37 years in the uncut stand (211 Mg ha–1). Corresponding values for mean annual increment (MAI) were 3.4–4.3 Mg ha–1 and 5.7 Mg ha–1. This study shows that the length of the rotation for birch in energy wood production should be longer than 21 years.

Weed control reduced seedling mortality by 27 percentage points in 21 years, but ash fertilization had no significant effect. Ash fertilization increased foliar potassium and boron concentrations, but its effect declined, and severe K-deficiency was recorded 21 years after planting. Up to the 9th year, weed control had a greater influence on growth than fertilization. Later the significance of fertilization increased due to an aggravated K-deficiency. Stand volume at year 21 for the untreated control plots was 8 m3 ha–1. Weed control and fertilization increased stand volume by 20 and 35 m3 ha–1, with a combined effect of 55 m3 ha–1. The effects of weed control and fertilization were additive and no significant interactions were found. Due to severe K-deficiencies, re-fertilization of all treatments would be necessary for the continued survival and growth of Scots pine.",

Recirculation of nutrients from wood chip combustion by ash spreading in forests has been proposed as a means for counteracting the nutrient export. This study was carried out to examine the effect of wood chip ash application on soil chemistry in a 44-year-old Norway spruce (Picea abies) plantation on a nutrient-poor soil in Denmark and to investigate the effect of applying different ash types and doses. Soil samples were collected and analyzed 2.5 years (3 growing seasons) after ash application. This study shows that, regardless of ash formulation, preparation or dose, application of wood ash to forest soil has a liming effect in the O-horizon manifested as an increase in CECe, BS and pH. This effect was not seen in the mineral soil within the time frame of this study. At the same time, an increase in Cd was found in the O-horizon, corresponding to the amount added in the ashes. Generally, no other increase in soil contents of the heavy metals was seen. Hardening of the wood ash did not decrease the chemical impact on the soil chemistry as compared to non-treated ash whereas an increase in ash application dose increases the liming effect.

A common understanding is that this ash should be spread in forests to counteract soil acidiﬁcation and potential future nutrient deﬁciencies, and thus help sustain longterm forest productivity. A series of seven ﬁeld experiments was established in Sweden in 1988–1995 to study the stem growth and needle nutrient concentrations of 30–60-year-old Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) stands on mineral soil after additions of wood ash in different doses or a combination of wood ash and N. The results showed that the most pronounced growth responses occurred when N was added, either alone or in combination with wood ash. The stem growth responses to additions of wood ash without N were small and variable, and not statistically signiﬁcant at any of the studied experimental sites. However, there were indications that the addition of wood ash may increase stem-wood growth on fertile sites and decrease it on less fertile sites. In the short term, the addition of wood ash tended to increase the needle nutrient concentrations of most analyzed elements, except for N, but this could not be correlated to responses in stem growth.",

The amount exported is increased when the logging residues are also removed for use as fuel. Recycling of the resulting wood ash has been advocated as a measure to compensate for the nutrient losses and to sustain future forest production. The physical formulation of the wood ash may have an important inﬂuence on its effects on soil properties. In this paper, we report effects of two different types of wood ash (one self-hardened and crushed, the other pelleted), with differences in solubility, on soil chemistry in the humus layer and upper 15 cm of the mineral soil, at two coniferous sites in south-central Sweden, 5 yr after their application. The crushed ash was applied at three doses (3, 6 and 9 ton ha–1), while the pelleted ash was applied at only one dose (3 ton ha–1). At both sites the soil was podzolized. The two sites differed with respect to soil conditions, despite being situated only a few kilometers apart. The application of wood ash increased both soil pH and base-cation content in the humus layer at both sites. In the mineral soil, the effects were less pronounced. Treatment effects on soil chemistry did not differ between the two ash formulations. The retention (i.e. the extractable amount of nutrients found in the soil that could be attributed to the ash application) of nutrients varied strongly between the two sites, and K retention (ca. 10%) was generally lower than that of Ca and Mg.",

Generally, there were only minor changes in the vegetation cover as a result of the treatments, and the species composition was unaltered after five years. When treated with hardened and crushed wood ash, the three most common bryophytes reacted rapidly, displaying severe visible damage in the initial phase of the study period. Two years after ash application, the bryophytes had started to recover, and after five years no visible damage could be discerned. At the highest ash dose (9 tons ha-1), however, the cover of bryophytes was significantly reduced, even after five years. No visible damage to the bryophytes was found after treatment with pelleted ash or after N treatment, and no visible damage to lichens was found for any treatment. However, by the end of the study period, the addition of wood ash, including the pelleted ash, had significantly reduced the cover of Cladina lichens. All wood ash treatments tended to lead to a decrease in the cover of dwarf shrubs. Nitrogen addition tended to increase the cover of Vaccinium myrtillus and decrease the cover of Vaccinium vitis-idaea and Calluna vulgaris. The results from this study highlight the need for legal restrictions on the chemical and physical properties of wood ash recycled within forest systems, in order to avoid a negative impact on ground flora.",

		"abstract": "In industrialized countries, it is expected that the future generation of bioenergy will be from the direct combustion of residues and wastes obtained from biomass. Bioenergy production using woody biomass is a fast developing application since this fuel source is considered to be carbon neutral. The harnessing of bioenergy from these sources produces residue in the form of ash. As the demand for bioenergy production increases, ash and residue volumes will increase. Major challenges will arise relating to the efficient management of these byproducts. The primary concerns for ash are its storage, disposal, use and the presence of unburned carbon. The continual increase in ash volume will result in decreased ash storage facilities (in cases of limited room for landfill expansion), as well as increased handling, transporting and spreading costs. The utilization of ash has been the focus of many studies, hence this review investigates the likely environmental and technological challenges that increased ash generation may cause. The presence of alkali metals, alkaline earth metals, chlorine, sulphur and silicon influences the reactivity and leaching to the inorganic phases which may have significant impacts on soils and the recycling of soil nutrient. Discussed are some of the existing technologies for the processing of ash. Unburned carbon present in ash allows for the exploration of using ash as a fuel. The paper proposes sieve fractionation as a suitable method for the separation of unburnt carbon present in bottom ash obtained from a fixed-bed combustion system, followed by the application of the gasification technology to particle sizes of energy importance. It is hoped that this process will significantly reduce the volume of ash disposed at landfills.",

		"abstract": "The direct combustion of biomass residues produces large quantities of bottom ash. Environmental sustainable management requires that ash recycling should be carried out whenever possible. Suitable applications of bottom ash are based predominantly on its chemical properties. The presence of major ash forming and trace elements along with other intrinsic properties unique to bottom ash, suggest its potential as a soil additive. But, ash quality must be of a high standard to prevent environmental pollution. This comparative study characterizes bottom ash obtained from three types of bioenergy systems - a fixed-bed boiler, a downdraft gasifier and a wood pellet burner. The chemical properties were analyzed and discussed for each bottom ash, together with their respective particle fractions that were obtained by sieving. The pH of the starting ash samples for the gasifier, boiler and pellet burner were 10.36, 12.49 and 13.46, respectively. Ni with a concentration of 229 mg/kg in the pellet burner ash, exceeded the maximum limit for soil amendments (in British Columbia, Canada) within the particle size fraction ≥ 850 µm but < 2000. All samples were significantly enriched in both Ca (50-61%) and K (10-26%). The elements Mg, Al, Mn, Fe, P and Na each contributed 10% or less to the inorganic portion of the ash. Concentrations of inorganic contents varied with particle size. Water soluble phosphates were very low in the samples. The results suggest that size fraction separation can be a useful method to isolate fractions containing higher (or lower) amounts of some metals. This method may be a useful technique for managing ash that contains elements exceeding environmental limits.",

We test this assumption by synthesizing results from long-term field trials in a metaanalysis. Overall, clearcutting significantly increased soil NO3-N concentration, NO3-N as a proportion of soluble inorganic nitrogen (SIN), N concentration in leachates, N flux, nitrification rates, and pH, but not total N, NH4-N, SIN concentration, ammonification, or N mineralization rate. The proportion of soil NO3-N in deciduous forests increased immediately and returned to preharvest levels within five years; the effect was delayed in coniferous forests, but levels remained elevated for several years. Deciduous leaf litter decomposed faster and needle litter decomposed more slowly on clearcut sites than in uncut forests. Single-tree selection caused smaller changes in NO3-N than removal of groups of trees (i.e., gap creation) and led to smaller increases in NO3-N as a proportion of SIN than clearcut harvesting. High levels of retention (>70%) were required to maintain uncut stand N-cycling characteristics. Postharvest NO3-N levels could be predicted from NO3-N availability in the uncut forests.",

		"abstract": "Wood ash is a beneﬁcial fertilizer and liming agent in nutrient depleted soils, but it also contains considerable amounts of cadmium (Cd), which can be toxic to organisms in the environment. Therefore, risk assessments regarding utilization of wood ash is required. Here, we studied how wood ash (applied in doses equivalent to 0, 3 and 6 t ha−1) and Cd (applied in doses of 0, 10, 150, 300, 600, 1200 and 2000 mg kg−1) aﬀected growth of the soil nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. The treatments were combined in a full factorial design. Wood ash alone greatly stimulated both soil respiration and growth of C. elegans, whereas Cd alone had a toxic eﬀect. However, unrealistically high Cd levels were needed to severely aﬀect growth of C. elegans and soil respiration, especially soil respiration was very resilient to Cd amendment. Ash addition decreased Cd toxicity to C. elegans, with an EC50 value of 390 mg Cd kg−1 in the 3 t ash ha−1 treatment, and an increase of EC50 to 1894 mg Cd kg−1 in the 6 t ash ha−1 treatment. This is probably because ash increases the Cd sorption capacity of the soil, and thereby decreases the bio-availability of Cd. The results suggest that there is no acute toxic eﬀect of Cd to nematodes associated with wood ash recycling; in fact, our results suggest that ash actually decrease Cd toxicity.",

The aim of the study was to identify the areas in which weathering and base cation deposition do not support leaching and uptake of base cations by vegetation. The effect of stem harvesting and whole-tree harvesting on the base cation balances was studied and preliminary calculations were made about the amounts of ash needed for compensation of the potential base cation depletion. The effect of sulphur emission reduction till 2010 was also considered. The study demonstrated that there would be depletion of base cations in forest mineral soils in southern, central and northeastern Finland (40–50% of the grids) in the long term if wholetree harvesting would be practised. Theoretical calculations showed that ash application would be most useful in those areas to compensate the base cation depletion. If stem harvesting is practised, only small areas (20%) in southwestern and southeastern Finland and northeastern Lapland would show depletion of base cations in the long term.",

		"abstract": "Wood ash fertilization increases the pH and concentration of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the soil solution and enhances the activity of soil microorganisms. However, it is unknown whether DOC or pH is primarily responsible for the increase in microbial activity. We designed an experiment to separate the effects of DOC and/or pH on soil microbial activity using suspensions of humus extracts and bacteria that had not previously been exposed to wood ash fertilization. After a 3-week incubation, DOC extracts were obtained from control (DOCC) and ash (DOCA) treatments with carbon concentrations of 9.1 and 32.5 mg C lÀ1, respectively. These extracts were supplied to bacterial suspensions at concentrations of 0 and 5 mg C lÀ1. We controlled for pH by matching adjustments, i.e. the original pH of the DOCC extract was 4.5 and its adjusted pH was 6.9, whereas the DOCA extract was pH 6.9 originally and pH 4.5 adjusted. The relative bacterial growth rate (RBGR), as measured by 3H-thymidine incorporation, increased in suspensions of 5 mg C lÀ1 DOC as compared to control suspensions of 0 mg C lÀ1. At pH 6.9, RBGR was higher for both DOC extracts than at pH 4.5. These results suggest that both DOC and pH inﬂuence microbial activity. As the growth rate at pH 6.9 with DOCA was higher than with DOCC, the quality of the DOC extract must also play a role since the carbon concentration was controlled for. The decrease in relative abundance of hydrophobic and hydrophilic acids in DOCA compared to DOCC indicates a quality shift. As measured by DGGE banding patterns, the bacterial community structure changed over the course of the 24-h experiment in the following three trials, all of which received 5 mg C lÀ1: DOCC at pH 6.9 and DOCA at pH 4.5 and 6.9. These results demonstrate that both the DOC origin (control vs. ash) and the pH inﬂuence a subset of the bacterial community.",

The frost sensitivity was measured as an index of injury, calculated from electrolytic leakage of bark samples. Samples were taken from the same trees in August and November at ®ve sites. Two sites had been limed, one treated with wood ash and two had been fertilized with nitrogen, one of them with an additional phosphorous fertilization. Trees fertilized with nitrogen had signi®cantly more lesions than trees from other treatments. The bark was more damaged at À208C than at À108C in both August and November at experimental conditions. No clear pattern in temperature sensitivity was detectable among sites or treatments approximately seven years after soil treatment.

In the Ohorizon, all treatments resulted in increased pH and higher exchangeableCa, K, Mg, CEC,and percent base saturation; Mnand A! decreased. In the B horizon, exchangeable Ca, K, Mg, and percent base saturation were higher than in the control. Responses in soil chemistry were not generally proportional to the ash application rate.

Karst.) plots on peat soils, where fertilization trials with 0.5 to 2 kg m-2 wood ash had been conducted ten years previously. We examined the long-term effects of wood ash fertilization on fine root development (biomass and mycorrhizal colonization) and on communities of ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi and other soil microorganisms. Soil microorganisms were assessed by recording the number of colony forming units (CFU) from soil dilution series. ECM fungi in fine roots were evaluated by morphotyping and identified by sequencing of the fungal ITS region of rRNA genes. Soil chemical analysis indicated significant differences in soil pH between control and fertilized Scots pine plots, but soil pH did not differ among Norway spruce plots. Fine root biomass, numbers of living fine roots and numbers of dead fine roots did not differ significantly among wood ash treatments and the control for either pine or spruce. Relative abundance of living fine roots and its mycorrhizal colonization differed significantly among treatments and effects of wood ash were largely determined by tree species and amount of wood ash applied. Numbers of bacterial CFUs were higher in pine plots than in spruce plots and some differences were evident between the wood ash treatments and the control. Numbers of fungal CFUs were similar in all treatments. Of 21 fungal species identified on fine roots, the most common were Amphinema byssoides, Agaricomycetes sp., Lactarius sp. and Tuber anniae. Species composition of ECM fungi was mainly determined by the host species. However, principal component analysis and comparison of relative abundances of some species indicated differences in species composition among wood ash treatments. In conclusion, our data provided some evidence of a long-term effect of wood ash fertilization on soil pH, abundance of soil bacteria and diversity of ECM fungal community.",

Emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) were measured using static dark chambers for two years following the ash treatment. The CO2 emission from the soil was signiﬁcantly reduced by 17–23% by both doses during 2006–2008. The mechanism behind the reduction could not be related to a direct inhibition of soil C mineralization by the ash. The emission of N2O was also signiﬁcantly reduced by 44 and 46% during the ﬁrst year, mainly due to reductions in the winter emissions. Similar reductions of 34 and 50% were found in the second year for the low and the high wood ash, respectively. Increased pH of the soil due to the ash additions may have caused the effect. The control and amended soils consumed ambient CH4. The low wood ash dose increased the annual net CH4 uptake rate by 9%, due to an increased winter uptake. No changes in tree growth could be detected over the short 2-year measurement period. The net effect of wood ash application was a reduction in the total GHG emissions during the ﬁrst two years after the treatment.",

		"abstract": "Two problems have become more topical in recent years – production of solid biofuel from wood and the utilisation of ash and organic waste, including waste water sludge. The purpose of this research is to model simultaneous solutions for both of these problems through their use as fertilizer and to identify useful indications for the use of waste water sludge and wood ash as fertilisers. Opportunities to boost the efficiency of the applications of waste water sludge by combined spreading with wood ash are addressed in this study. An experiment is carried out in vegetation pots with different proportions of peat, sludge and ash to determine the impact of stem and root system development related to chemical and nutrient availability. Due to these studies, it is determined that waste water sludge has a comparably small liming effect. The fertilising effect of sludge can be increased by the admixture of wood ash and dolomite. These materials reduce the acidity of the soil and provide additional nutrients. Using dolomite as a liming material in the amount of 10 t ha-1 secures a change in pH of 0.6–1.2 units in peat soil. Significant changes in pH were found just a few centimetres into the upper layer of the soil. The application of an equal amount of wood ash produces a faster effect in terms of neutralisation. The limiting element is phosphorus. However, the mineralisation of peat increases the percentile proportion of all mineral elements in substrates as well as heavy metals.",

To reach this goal, 70 parameters were studied. The main results showed that the two studied ﬂy ashes Soproline® and Sodeline® had a positive inﬂuence on soil characteristics especially the availability of metals, nearly 14 years after amendment. Regarding biological parameters, no positive or negative eﬀects were found by adding ﬂy ashes to the soil concerning soil basal respiration and urease activity. The fungal activity was even enhanced. In the same way, the ﬂy ashes had no negative eﬀect on the Diptera larvae community and a greater richness of larvae was even found in amended soils. Thus, this study conﬁrmed that aided-phytostabilisation using these ﬂy ashes should be an advantageous technique to manage metal-polluted soils and to recycle industrial wastes.",

		"abstract": "Soil amendment with biochar is evaluated globally as a means to improve soil fertility and to mitigate climate change. However, the effects of biochar on soil biota have received much less attention than its effects on soil chemical properties. A review of the literature reveals a signiﬁcant number of early studies on biochar-type materials as soil amendments either for managing pathogens, as inoculant carriers or for manipulative experiments to sorb signaling compounds or toxins. However, no studies exist in the soil biology literature that recognize the observed large variations of biochar physico-chemical properties. This shortcoming has hampered insight into mechanisms by which biochar inﬂuences soil microorganisms, fauna and plant roots. Additional factors limiting meaningful interpretation of many datasets are the clearly demonstrated sorption properties that interfere with standard extraction procedures for soil microbial biomass or enzyme assays, and the confounding effects of varying amounts of minerals. In most studies, microbial biomass has been found to increase as a result of biochar additions, with signiﬁcant changes in microbial community composition and enzyme activities that may explain biogeochemical effects of biochar on element cycles, plant pathogens, and crop growth. Yet, very little is known about the mechanisms through which biochar affects microbial abundance and community composition. The effects of biochar on soil fauna are even less understood than its effects on microorganisms, apart from several notable studies on earthworms. It is clear, however, that sorption phenomena, pH and physical properties of biochars such as pore structure, surface area and mineral matter play important roles in determining how different biochars affect soil biota. Observations on microbial dynamics lead to the conclusion of a possible improved resource use due to co-location of various resources in and around biochars. Sorption and thereby inactivation of growth-inhibiting substances likely plays a role for increased abundance of soil biota. No evidence exists so far for direct negative effects of biochars on plant roots. Occasionally observed decreases in abundance of mycorrhizal fungi are likely caused by concomitant increases in nutrient availability, reducing the need for symbionts. In the short term, the release of a variety of organic molecules from fresh biochar may in some cases be responsible for increases or decreases in abundance and activity of soil biota. A road map for future biochar research must include a systematic appreciation of different biochar-types and basic manipulative experiments that unambiguously identify the interactions between biochar and soil biota.",

Sweden is at the forefront of research and development on forest-based bioenergy and has employed a model of science-based policy development to implement bioenergy production systems. In response to environmental concerns over whole-tree harvesting for bioenergy in Sweden, a number of government-funded research programs on forest-derived bioenergy have been undertaken with the intent of generating knowledge about the effects of whole-tree harvesting, ash recycling and bioenergy-related silvicultural practices on ecological systems and values such as soil, nutrient balances, water, biodiversity, greenhouse gas balances and recreation. Sweden developed a series of recommendations and good-practice guidelines for whole tree harvesting starting in 1986 and ending with the most recent revision in 2008. These guidelines and regulations are based on various scientific studies and include prescriptions and mandates to minimize environmental damage caused by whole tree harvesting for bioenergy. From the beginning, the process of developing effective guidelines and regulations governing whole tree harvesting in Sweden has been informed by science. Guidelines and regulations govern the areas of site productivity, utilization of recycled wood ash, biodiversity and physical damage to trees and soils. Overall, Sweden’s experience demonstrates the way in which science can be used to inform guidelines and policies.",

		"abstract": "Increased use of bioenergy has increased the production of wood ash in power plants. Wood ash is used as a fertilizer to improve tree stand growth in nitrogen-rich peatland forests. Nutrients removed during tree harvest are recycled back to the forest by wood ash fertilization. However, there is a risk that ash enhances microbial processes and associated nitrous oxide (N2O) production in peat. Because there are difﬁculties in spreading loose ash, ash is nowadays granulated or hardened in other ways before it is applied as fertilizer. Granulation process changes not only the physical but also the chemical properties of ash. In previous studies wood ash has showed variable effects on N2O emissions. Nevertheless, there are indications that in laboratory conditions granulated wood ash decreases N2O production. We conducted laboratory experiments to investigate the capability of granulated wood ash to decrease N2O production in peat soils and the role of nitriﬁcation and denitriﬁcation in N2O production. Acetylene inhibition experiments showed that N2O production was dominated by nitriﬁcation over denitriﬁcation. The rate of nitriﬁcation as well as N2O production from nitriﬁcation and denitriﬁcation decreased by the addition of granulated wood ash. Wood ash addition increased peat electrical conductivity while peat pH remained unchanged. The inhibitory effect of ash was associated to ion content because isolated ion addition experiments produced a similar decline in N2O production. The inhibition of ions was more evident in acidic conditions because when peat pH was increased by addition of lime, the ions or granulated ash inhibited N2O production signiﬁcantly less than they did at natural peat pH. Our results show that manipulation of ion strength could offer a new tool to slow nitriﬁcation and denitriﬁcation processes and decrease the associated N2O emissions in acidic soils.",

We also tested whether microarthropod communities stressed with wood ash were more sensitive to an additional disturbance, drought, than the microarthropod communities in the ash-free soil. Microarthropods were sampled five times during the field experiment and four times during the laboratory experiment. At each sampling the abundance and community structure of microarthropods were analysed. In the field the number of collembolans, and in the laboratory the number of mesostigmatid mites decreased after ash-treatment. Although in both experiments the number of oribatid mite species was lower in the ash-treated than in the control soil, principal component analysis revealed no changes in the community structure of microarthropods after the ash application. Drought had no influence on soil microarthropods. It is concluded that soil microarthropods, at least at the community level, are rather resistant to substantial changes in soil pH even though changes at the species level can take place, and that microarthropods stressed with wood ash are not more susceptible to other disturbance (drought) than microarthropod communities in the ash-free soils.",

Coniferous forest soil, inoculated with soil microbes and nematodes, was either treated with wood ash or left as ash-free control. Wood ash (corresponding to an amount of 5000 kg ha−1) was either spread on the soil surface or mixed into the soil. Enchytraeid and pine seedling biomass, abundance of nematodes, and water leachable NH4+-N and NO3−-N were measured 26 and 51 weeks after initiation of the experiment and root length and N concentration of needles were measured 51 weeks after initiation of the experiment. Wood ash when mixed into the soil, reduced the biomass of C. sphagnetorum. Nematodes were unaffected by the treatments. In the ash-free soils C. sphagnetorum had little inﬂuence on pine growth, but it did decrease root length and root to shoot ratio. In the absence of enchytraeids wood ash decreased pine biomass production and root length. However, the presence of enchytraeids in the ash-treated soil compensated the ashinduced negative effects on the pine performance. Enchytraeids increased and wood ash decreased water leachable NH4+-N in the presence but not in the absence of enchytraeids, while water leachable NO3−-N was not affected by the treatments. It was concluded that C. sphagnetorum can be important in ensuring nutrient cycling and plant growth in situations when an ecosystem encounters disturbances.",

		"abstract": "A 3 yr experiment, using ®eld lysimeters with seedlings of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) growing in raw humus, was established to study how functional complexity of the soil decomposer food web affects ecosystem functioning. The functional complexity of decomposer system was manipulated by (1) allowing either microfauna (®ne mesh) or microfauna 1 mesofauna (coarse mesh) to enter the initially defaunated systems, and (2) treating half of the lysimeters with wood ash. To test whether altering functional complexity of the decomposer community is related to the system's ability to resist disturbance, the lysimeters were later on disturbed with drought. Ecosystem function, measured as leaching of mineral N and dissolved organic C (DOC) and primary production, and the structure and biomass of soil fauna and soil microbial communities were analysed. We hypothesised that reduced functional complexity of soil decomposer communities retards system functioning which results in impaired ability of soil systems to resist disturbance. Fine mesh was effective in reducing biomass of mesofauna, especially that of microarthropods, in the lysimeters. Leaching of N from the lysimeters and microbial communities were unaffected by the mesh size. Before drought, more DOC was leached from the lysimeters with ®ne mesh. Pine seedling development was poorer in the lysimeters with coarse mesh than in those with ®ne mesh. Wood ash, independently of the mesh size, increased number of nematodes and leaching of NO32±N (only after drought), decreased leaching of NH41±N and changed microbial community structure. The conditions for the pine seedlings were less favourable in the ash-treated than in the ash-free soils as indicated by the higher root-to-shoot ratio in the former lysimeters. The system's ability to resist disturbance was not affected by the treatments. Our results suggest that the abiotic factors (e.g. moisture, pH) overrode the biotic factors in the lysimeters with respect to ecosystem functioning, and that the changes in the structure and biomass of soil fauna were not re¯ected as changes in system functioning. q 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

We established a laboratory experiment to study whether the effects of Cognettia sphagnetorum (Enchytraeidae) and ectomycorrhizal fungi on Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) seedling growth are inﬂuenced by wood ash application. Acidic coniferous forest soil was treated with wood ash at 5000 kg haÀ1 or left as ash-free control and inoculated with soil saprotrophic microbes and nematodes. The microcosms were destructively sampled 26 and 51 weeks after initiation of the experiment. We measured enchytraeid and pine seedling biomass, abundance of nematodes and leaching of NH4+-N and NO3À-N at both samplings, and root length and N concentration of pine needles at the end of the experiment. On average enchytraeids and mycorrhizal fungi enhanced pine biomass production in the ash-free control soils, however, their impact was most pronounced when these organisms were alone in the systems. In fact, mycorrhizas tended to have a negative impact on the seedlings in the presence of enchytraeids. Wood ash had a clear negative impact on enchytraeid populations. Wood ash decreased pine growth when enchytraeids and EM-fungi were alone in the systems, but when together they apparently compensated for the negative effects of wood ash on the seedlings. It is concluded that interactions between soil fauna, mycorrhizal fungi and plants are context dependent, thereby rendering predictions of the outcome of species interactions in soil food webs a demanding task.",

Part of the sample population was from sites that had been treated with ash 1.5 years earlier, part from untreated control sites. The ash increased the soil pH and gave an average cadmium load in soil of 44 g haϪ1. When comparing treated and control areas, we found slightly but significantly lower Cd concentrations in vole muscle, liver, and kidney from treated plots, whereas the Cd concentrations in shrew tissues were greater in animals from treated plots. In voles we detected an increase in Cd concentrations during the 45-d sampling period in treated and untreated plots. The relative weight of kidneys was greater from the ash-treated areas than untreated areas for both voles and shrews. The difference in Cd concentrations between the voles and shrews could be explained by the different food habits.",

Cadmium concentrations of some forest insects (Formica ants, carabids and Coleopteran larvae from decaying wood) were investigated in southern Finland, where two plots were fertilized with wood ash, while two other plots represented unfertilized control plots. In ants, mean Cd concentration was 3.6 ± 1.4 mg/kg, with nest workers having significantly higher concentrations than workers trapped in pitfall traps. Concentrations at fertilized and unfertilized plots were similar. In carabid beetles, the average Cd concentration of Carabus glabratus was 0.44 ± 0.36 mg/kg, with no significant difference between control plots and fertilized plots. In another carabid beetle, Pterostichus niger, mean Cd concentration was higher at fertilized plots compared to control plots. We conclude that the variation of Cd concentrations in the insects studied is more efficiently controlled by species-specific differences than fertilization history of the forest floor.",

		"abstract": "Whole catchment liming or forest liming has been proposed and implemented as a countermeasure to the effects of elevated sulphur deposition. Since the end of the 1980s the Swedish Forest Agency has undertaken experimental forest liming experiments in selected catchments in southern Sweden. These studies were with low doses (3 tonnes haÀ1) of lime (CaCO3) and dolomite (CaMg(CO3)2). Data from both soil samples and stream water samples have been collected for the 16 years following treatment. The stream data has been complemented with data from untreated catchments, from the Swedish monitoring stream network. Signiﬁcant differences due to treatment were seen for Ca, cation exchange capacity (CEC) and base saturation (BS) in the humus layer, none of these variables showed a statistically signiﬁcant change in the mineral soil due to treatment alone. Soil samples from both the treated and untreated sites showed temporal changes in both the humus layer and the mineral soils with increases in pH, Ca and CEC and decreases in BS and Al which were independent of treatment. A combination of treatment and time, gave signiﬁcant changes in BS and TA down to 10 cm in the mineral soil. In the stream water samples no statistically signiﬁcant differences were observed between treated and untreated sites. Regardless of treatment, the streams exhibited a general pattern of declining concentrations of SO4, Ca, sum of base cations (BC) and increasing acid neutralizing capacity (ANC). In summary, the application of a low dose of lime (3 tonnes haÀ1) did not result in signiﬁcant changes in surface water chemistry in the study catchments and changes in soil chemistry were mainly restricted to the humus layer during the 16 years following treatment. The natural recovery, as a result of reductions in sulphur deposition, dominated the effects and was clearly seen in both the treated and untreated study sites. MAGIC simulations indicate that this recovery will continue in the coming decades.",

		"abstract": "Predictions of changes in soil solution chemistry and exchangeable cations which occur on ash deposition after slash burning are complex and may be facilitated by the use of chemical models. Multi-ion sorption in the topsoil of an Amazonian Acrisol was studied by sequentially adding small amounts of electrolytes to soil and mixtures of soil and ash in batch experiments. A chemical equilibrium model that included inorganic complexation, multiple cation exchange and sparingly soluble salts (aluminium hydroxide and magnesian calcites) was used to interpret the results. The model predicted well the pH and sorption values in all experiments in which there was no addition of ash. The model suggested that cation exchange was the main process determining concentrations of soil solutions in all cases where neutral salt solutions were added, and that proton buffering was achieved by the dissolution of Al(OH)3 which was followed by Al3+ adsorption. Calculation of ion activity products in solutions from various batch experiments in soil + ash mixtures suggested that magnesian calcites of differing solubility may be in equilibrium with the activities of Mg2+ and Ca2+ in solution. An incongruent dissolution of Mg resulted in less soluble magnesian calcites in the ash. The model estimated satisfactorily the pH and the sorption of ions for all experiments with differing ash additions to the soil. Most of the Ca and signi®cant amounts of Mg added in the ash are expected to remain for a long time in the soil and may determine the Ca and Mg status of the soil solution, primarily controlled by principles of solubility products.",

Comparative-analytical studies were conducted in seven sample plots treated with different doses of wood ash (0.25, 0.5 and 1.0 kg m2) and in a control plot without treatment. For anatomical analyses cross-sections of needles of one and two-year-old were made. These were stained, photographed under microscope and measured. Analysis showed that, in general, the current-year needles had the largest average value of anatomical characteristics in all sample plots. At the same time the xylem of the needles of pines from the sample plot with wood ash application of 1.0 kg m2 and from the control plot increased with age. Significant differences (p < 0.05) in the anatomical characteristic between the needles from trees growing on sample plots treated with 0.5 and 1.0 kg m2 and the control plot were detected. The greatest anatomical differences between these needles were detected in the oldest needles. Histochemical analysis showed a greater degree of lignification of cellular walls in older needles and more intensive accumulation of lignin in the needles from sample plots treated with 0.5 and 1.0 kg m2. Morphological measurements showed the positive trends in the length and mass of needles at 0.25 kg m2 wood ash doses.",

		"abstract": "Forests in southern Sweden are exposed to acidic deposition, which may ultimately become detrimental to the vitality and growth of the forests. The aim of the present work was to study the leaching of a range of physiologically important ions after different treatments representing high loads of N and other acidifying substances, as well as the effects of treatments aimed to counteract soil acidi®cation (additions of lime, ash and vitality fertilizer). We compared the leaching from two types of lysimeters (``ingrowth'' with, and ``trenched'' without, active tree roots) at two sites in the south and two sites in the north of Sweden. Generally, considerably larger amounts of ions were leached from trenched than ingrowth cores, and from the southern as compared to the northern sites. Additions of N caused, in the presence of tree roots, increased leaching of inorganic N in the north, and in the south of not just N, but also Ca, Mg, Mn and Al. Liming caused increased NO3À leaching only in the absence of roots at an N-rich site. Indications of soil Mg depletion were found after limestone addition. Vitality fertilizer caused no change in the leaching of ions in ingrowth cores. The study emphasizes the importance of tree root uptake, i.e. of healthy forest stands, to counteract the acidifying leaching of base cations, as well as Al and NO3À from mineral soils. # 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

		"abstract": "Anthropogenic acid deposition causes forest soil acidiﬁcation and perturbation of the soil forming processes. The impact of soil acidiﬁcation on tree growth is discussed in view of the role of mycorrhizal fungi in weathering and nutrient uptake. A review has been carried out of experiments involving treatments of forest soil by lime and wood ash, where soil properties and soil solution composition have been investigated. Results from these experiments in Europe and North America are summarized. In general, the content of C in the mor layer decreased as a result of treatment due to higher microbial activity and soil respiration as well as increased leakage of DOC. In addition, the content of N in the mor layer, in general, decreased after treatment and there are occasional peaks of high NO3 concentrations in soil solution. In nearly all reviewed investigations the pH of the deep mineral soil solution decreased and Al, SO4 and NO3 concentrations increased after treatment. These effects are probably due to the high ionic strength and increased microbial activity as a consequence of the treatments. In the soil, pH, CEC and base saturation increased in the upper horizons, but decreases in the upper mineral soil are also reported. In general, there was no increase in tree growth as a result of these treatments. The positive effects of the treatments on soil processes and tree growth are therefore questionable. In view of these conclusions, an investigation was carried out on the soil and soil solution chemistry and the role of mycorrhizal fungi in a spruce stand treated with two doses of lime and another treated with lime/ash in southern Sweden. The results of this investigation is reported in this volume.",

Thus, in 1990, a harvesting study with three main treatments was conducted in an old-ﬁeld white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss) stand in Prince Edward Island, Canada. The treatments included whole-tree harvesting (WTH) with chain saws, in which almost all the aboveground biomass was removed from the site, stem-only (SO) harvest, consisting of chainsaw felling and removal of only the merchantable boles from the site, and control (CON), an uncut area. Glass-body lysimeters, connected to hanging-bottle vacuum generators, were installed at three depths to collect soil solution. The leachates collected over a 6-year period (1991–1997) were analyzed for pH and various anions and cations. Soil temperatures were also measured at three depths.",

		"abstract": "In Sweden application of granulated wood ash has been suggested as a method to supplement nutrient loss resulting from harvesting of forest residues for bioenergy production. Mycelia of two ectomycorrhizal fungi Piloderma sp. 1 and Ha-96-3, were commonly found to colonise ash granules in a wood ash fertilised spruce forest. Thirty-eight fungal isolates were selected from 10 taxa to investigate the possible role of different ectomycorrhizal fungi in nutrient mobilisation from ash. The taxa were Cenococcum geophilum Fr., Piloderma croceum Erikss. and Hjortst., Piloderma sp. 1, Thelephora terrestris (Ehrenb.) Fr., Tylospora fibrillosa Donk, and five unidentified species, all originating from a wood ash fertilised spruce forest. The isolates were tested for their ability to solubilise tricalcium phosphate (TCP) or hardened wood ash (HWA) in vitro. Ha-96-3, P. croceum and Piloderma sp. 1 were the only taxa which solubilised TCP. Abundant calcium oxalate crystals were formed in TCP and HWA plates with Piloderma sp. 1. Ha-96-3 and two isolates of P. croceum produced intermediate amounts of crystals. Ha-96-1 and T. fibrillosa produced low amounts of crystal but no crystal formation was observed by any of the other isolates. Piloderma sp. 1 from HWA plates had significantly higher concentrations of P, compared to P. croceum or Ha-96-3. Piloderma sp. 1 and P. croceum were further tested for their ability to colonise wood ash in microcosms containing intact mycorrhizal associations. After 7 months Piloderma sp. 1 colonised ash amended patches with a dense, mat like mycelium, whereas P. croceum mycelia avoided the ash patches. Possible differences between these fungi in patterns of carbon allocation were investigated by labelling seedlings with 14CO2. Piloderma sp. 1 mycelia allocated significantly more 14C to ash patches than P. croceum. P. croceum allocated relatively more 14C to control patches than to the ash patches.

Ash treatment had a highly significant, positive effect on plant growth and on shoot and root concentrations of K, Ca and P, irrespective of mycorrhizal status. Mycorrhizal inoculation had a significant effect on plant growth, which was proportionally greater in the absence of ash. N addition had a significant positive effect on plant biomass in mycorrhizal treatments with ash, but no effect in non-mycorrhizal treatments or most of the mycorrhizal treatments without ash. Piloderma sp. 1, which was earlier found to colonise wood ash granules in field studies, appeared to accumulate Ca from ash in the mycorrhizal roots. 5^6.7% of the total P in the ash was solubilised, with 0.9^1.5% in solution, 3.6^4.6% in the plants and 0.5^1.5% in microbial biomass.

Soil cores were used to obtain estimates of the biomass (g mÀ2) of roots in three diameter classes (<0.5, 0.5–1 and 1–2 mm), root length density (RLD), speciﬁc root length (SRL) and mycorrhizal root tip density (RTD). Fine root (<1 mm) length production and mortality, and mycelium production, were estimated using minirhizotron and mesh bag techniques, respectively. Compared with the control plots (C), the biomass of ﬁne roots in diameter classes <0.5 mm and 0.5–1 mm was signiﬁcantly higher in A plots, but lower in SR plots. In addition, RLD was signiﬁcantly lower in the humus layer of SR plots than in the humus layers of C and A plots, but not in the other layers. None of the treatments affected the SRL. In all soil layers, the SR treatment resulted in signiﬁcant reductions in the number of ectomycorrhizal root tips, and the mycelia production of fungi in mesh bags, relative to the C treatment, but the C and A treatments induced no signiﬁcant changes in these variables. Fine root length production in the C, A and SR plots amounted to 94, 87 and 70 mm tubeÀ1 during the 2003 growing season, respectively. Fine root mortality in treated plots did not change over the course of the study. We suggest that leaving logging residues on fertile sites may result in nitrogen mineralisation, which may in turn induce reductions in root biomass, and both root and mycelium production, and consequently affect nutrient uptake and the accumulation of organic carbon in soil derived from roots and mycorrhizae.",

However, ash increased the CH4 oxidation in a forest soil proﬁle which could be seen both in the laboratory experiments and in the CH4 uptake rates in situ. The mean in situ CH4 uptake rate in the untreated, N, ash and ash + N plots were 153 ± 5, 123 ± 8, 188 ± 10 and 178 ± 18 lg m)2 h)1, respectively.",

The results obtained on the impact of wood ash on the concentration of lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose in spruce tissues showed that the responses to different wood ash doses were often opposite in different organs of trees. The content of lignin calculated on dry matter basis was on average 25% in shoots and stems, 24% in roots and 10% in needles. The stems and roots of trees have the highest cellulose contents – 31% and 27%, respectively and no statistically signiﬁcant changes were observed after the treatment with wood ash.

The experiments were conducted with 1-year-old seedlings planted in vegetation pots. The pH of the substrate was increased by 0.4e0.9 units during the vegetation period compared to the control. The peat substrate was poor in nutrients, except N. The substrate treated with WA had higher concentrations of K, Mg, Mn, Fe, P, Zn, Cr and Pb, but a lower N concentration compared to the control. The substrate treated with PA had higher concentrations of Ca, Mg, N and P. The concentrations in the MA treatment were intermediate between WA and PA. The ashes increased K and lowered the concentration of Ca. A decrease in N in seedlings was found under the inﬂuence of WA and MA. An increase in K and P was found in all compartments of seedlings, while the concentrations of Ca, Mg, Cu, Zn, Cd and Cr in seedlings were affected irregularly depending on types and doses of ashes used. The uptake of Cd, Cr and Pb did not reach phytotoxic levels; however, increased concentrations of Cd and Pb were found in roots. A positive inﬂuence of ash application on growth was found.

		"abstract": "Use of biofuels in the form of logging residues is increasing in the European countries. This intensive forestry, where entire trees are removed from the felling sites, may contribute to a negative nutrient balance in the forest soil. Recycling of ash from the combustion of clean wood fuel, sometimes in combination with limestone or additives/binders, back into the forest soil could maintain the soil nutrient reservoir intact. Before spreading ash, it is important to determine its contents and, particularly, its decomposition pattern using reliable laboratory leaching tests. In this study, mineralogy and the leaching of Na, Ca, K, Mg, Mn, Al, Cu, Fe, P, and Zn from wood ash pellets and granules, produced both from green liquor sludge and ﬂy ash, are examined by XRD and by subjecting these substances to three diﬀerent laboratory leaching tests: upﬂow percolation (CEN/TS 14405), batch leaching (SS-EN12457), and a new Swedish leaching test using a magnetic stirrer. Mineral phases such as quartz, ettringite, calcite, gehlenite, and aphtitalite were identiﬁed in the ash granules and in the ash/green liquor sludge granules, by means of XRD. Six additional minerals were detected in the granules of ash only, and another six in the ash/green liquor sludge granules. At L/S 2, the batch leaching test resulted in the highest amounts of elements leached and the upﬂow percolation test the lowest. At L/S 10, both the batch leaching test and the upﬂow percolation test resulted in high amounts of elements leached. The batch leaching test at L/S 10 complies quite well with the percolation test and could be suitable for ash/green liquor sludge granule evaluation in daily practice. The magnetic stirrer test seems to underestimate the release potential of elements from granules. The batch test is simple to perform, and has the ability to dissolve 70–80% of the elements with the highest mobility from the materials under study.",

Overall mass loss of the mineral ash ranged from 23--48% depending on wood type. The mass of K, S, B, Na, and Cu decreased, whereas Mg, P, Mn, AI, Fe, and Si did not change with temperature relative to Ca which was assumed to be constant. Sintering of the ash occurred, but fusion of the ash did not occur. In the 600°C ash CaCO3 and K2Ca(CO3)2 were identified, whereas in 1300°C ash CaO and MgO were the main compounds.

In this study, we compared the effects of wood ash and PK fertiliser on the volume growth and nutritional status of Scots pine stands. The data were collected from 4 field experiments established on drained mires in northern Finland. The living trees were measured in 1996 - 2001 to reconstruct the stand development back to the time of the fertilisation. Needle samples were taken when 1520 years had passed from the fertilisation. The rate and the magnitude of the growth response were in direct proportion with the thickness of the peat layer and the N-status of tree stand. With similar doses of phosphorus, PK-fertilisation increased stem volume growth faster than wood ash. The effect of ash became stronger when 15 years had elapsed from the treatment. On oligotrophic and shallow-peated sites, where the stand was suffering from the lack of usable nitrogen, PK fertiliser had no effect on tree growth, whereas the effect of ash seemed to become evident after ten year. Significant increases in foliar concentrations of phosphorus, potassium, and boron were observed 20 years after treatment in all of the PK and wood ash fertilised stands. Ash treatment increased also needle dry mass and PK treatment decreased zinc concentration in needles.",

The nutritional status and volume growth of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) after varying doses of wood ash fertilization were investigated in seven field experiments located on deep-peated sites in Finland between latitudes 63°N and 67°N. Needle samples were taken 14–20 years after fertilization and trees measured 15 years after fertilization. Annual growth rates and differences in foliar nutrients were analyzed with a two-way ANOVA model. A regression model was used in the analysis of periodic relative volume growth. High doses of wood ash (100–265 kg P·ha–1, 225–450 kg K·ha–1) resulted in greater changes in foliar nutrient concentrations and in a stronger growth response than low doses (5–50 kg P·ha–1, 14–210 kg K·ha–1). Significant increases in needle mass and concentrations of P, K, and B were observed in the ash-fertilized stands, with a good status for these elements 20 years after fertilization. Depending on the ash dose, the mean annual volume growth was 0.5–1.4 m3·ha–1 higher than in the control plots during the 15 year postfertilization period.",

		"abstract": "A number of experiments have been established at the Finnish Forest Research Institute during the last few decades to study the effect of wood ash application on soil substrate, ground vegetation and stand growth on drained mires and mineral soil forests. In this study, the plots of 23 experiments were sampled to determine whether ash application signiﬁcantly increases heavy metal accumulation in forest berries and mushrooms. Both short-term (between 2 months and 4 years) and long-term effects (between 10 and 52 years after application) were studied. The heavy metal concentrations (Al, Fe, Mn, Zn, Cr, Cu, Cd, As, Ni, Pb, Ti, V and Mo) were measured using ICP-AES. No signiﬁcant increase in heavy metal accumulation in the cloudberry (Rubus chamaemorus), cowberry (Vaccinium vitis-idaea) and bog whortleberry (Vaccinium uliginosum) or in the caps and stipes of russule (Russula paludosa), rufous milk-cap (Lactarius rufus), northern milk-cap (Lactarius trivialis), velvet bolete (Suillus variegatus) and in-rolled paxil (Paxillus involutus) was usually observed. In contrast, in the older experiments (13–52 years), the concentrations were often lower than those in the controls, except for As. Cd concentrations in cloudberry, bog whortleberry, in-rolled paxil and rufous milk-cap occasionally decreased signiﬁcantly. The results indicated that this ash-induced decrease in heavy metal accumulation may be a long-term effect. The concentrations of Al, Fe, As, Ni and Ti in the mushrooms were occasionally very high in the younger ash experiments (2–14 months after application); probably it was a case of surface contamination by heavy metal-rich ash residue, rather than active metal uptake. It was concluded that the heavy metals brought into the ecosystem by ash application are unlikely to be accumulated in any considerable amounts in forest berries and mushrooms.",

At the trial establishment in 1985, the trees were suffering from P and K deficiencies, but their N status was good. The fertilizer treatments were Control, PK (rock phosphate + potassium chloride), ApaBio (apatite phosphorus + biotite) and wood ash, applied both with and without N and replicated six times. All treatments containing phosphorus and potassium increased foliar P and K concentrations above the deficiency limits up to the end of the study period of 26 years. The effect of the fertilization on stand volume growth of Scots pine was strong and continued still at the end of the study period. The trees on ApaBio and PK plots grew nearly two-fold and those on Ash plots over two-fold compared with the control plots. In a thinning made at the end of the study period the total logging removal on fertilized plots was 1.5–2.2 times greater and included more saw logs than on the control plots. Ash fertilizer treatment outperformed other fertilizer treatments as well as the control. With a 5% discounted equivalent annual income (EAI) of Ash fertilizer treatment was statistically significantly (p = 0.009) almost three times higher than that of control. As a conclusion, fertilization (either using PK fertilizers or Ash) in N-rich drained peatlands is a financially feasible method of management.",

		"abstract": "Forested peatlands contain large pools of terrestrial carbon. As well as drainage, forest management such as fertilizer application can affect these pools. We studied the effect of wood ash (application rates 0, 5 and 15 t ha−1) on the heterotrophic soil respiration (CO2 efﬂux), cellulose decomposition, soil nutrients, biomass production and amount of C accumulated in a tree stand on a pine-dominated drained mire in central Finland. The ash was spread 13 years before the respiration measurements. The annual CO2 efﬂux was statistically modelled using soil temperature as the driving variable. Wood ash application increased the amounts of mineral nutrients of peat substantially and increased soil pH in the uppermost 10 cm layer by 1.5–2 pH units. In the surface peat, the decomposition rate of cellulose in the ash plots was roughly double that in control plots. Annual CO2 efﬂux was least on the unfertilized site, 238 g CO2-C m−2 year−1. The use of wood ash nearly doubled CO2 efﬂux to 420–475 g CO2-Cm−2 year−1 on plots fertilized with 5–15 t ha−1 of ash, respectively. Furthermore, ash treatments resulted also in increased stand growth, and during the measurement year, the growing stand on ash plots accumulated carbon 11–12 times faster than the control plot. The difference between peat C emission and amount of C sequestered by trees on the ash plots was 43–58 g C m−2, while on the control plot it was 204 g C m−2. Our conclusion is that adding wood ash as a fertilizer increases more C sequestration in the tree stand than C efﬂux from the peat.",

		"abstract": "The application to soils of energy co-products derived from forest biomass (biochar [BC] and wood ash [WA]) with the aim of regulating soil hydraulic conductivity and water availability, thereby reducing soil erosion and increasing resilience to drought, has been suggested as a strategy for climate change mitigation and adaptation. The main objective of this study was to investigate the eﬀects of BC and WA application on the hydraulic properties of contrasting aﬀorested soils in the Atlantic region of the Iberian Peninsula. Two experimental sites were established on acidic soils: site ES-K was established on a loamy soil (SOC% 3.9; pH: 4.8) and site ES-O on a sandy loam soil (SOC% 10.8; pH: 3.8). Biochar derived from Miscanthus sp. (pyrolysed at 450 °C: containing 87% C) was applied at rates of 0, 3.5 and 10 Mg ha−1 to soil in ES-K and at rates of 0, 10 and 20 Mg ha−1 to soil in ES-O. Pine WA (30% C) was applied at rates of 0, 1.5 and 4.5 Mg ha−1 to ES-K, and at rates of 0, 4.5 and 9 Mg ha− 1 to ES-O. Nitrogen- enriched (0.8% N) BC and WA were also applied at rates of respectively 10 Mg ha− 1 and 4.5 Mg ha−1 in both experimental sites. Bulk density, saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks), porosity and aggregate size distribution were determined and soil water retention curves (SWRCs) constructed. In ES-K, application of N-enriched WA (4.5 Mg ha−1) led to alterations in the SWRCs and reduced the available water capacity (AWC) by 11.5%; the lowest dose of WA (1.5 Mg ha−1) reduced Ks due to pore-clogging. In ES-O, changes were observed in the soil structure after application of BC (20 Mg ha−1) and WA (9 Mg ha− 1) as well as after application of the N-enriched materials. However, no eﬀects on available water content or saturated hydraulic conductivity were observed ﬁfteen months after the treatments. Further ﬁeld research is required to determine the soil speciﬁc, long-lasting eﬀects of BC and WA on soil structure and soil hydraulic properties.",

		"abstract": "Pulp and paper mills produce organic wastewater treatment residuals, inorganic process residues, and ash that have potential value as soil amendments in southem pine plantations. Chemical characteristics of 18 organic and 10 inorganic residues from 11 southem US pulp and paper mills were determined, and loblolly pine seedling growth response to their use as soil amendments was evaluated in two greenhouse studies. Fourteen of these 28 residues were then used in field studies in which they were incorporated into soil during establishment of pine plantations at three different sites. Under greenhouse conditions, seedling growth was increased by soil incorporation of most of the secondary wastewater treatment residuals at rates equivalent to 22.4 or 134.4 Mg • ha~'. In contrast to these greenhouse studies, under field conditions seedling growth was either unaffected or reduced when secondary wastewater treatment residuals were incorporated into soil at these same rates at plantation establishment. Seedling growth in soil amended with primary wastewater treatment residuals was generally no greater and in some cases significantly less than in the untreated control in both greenhouse and field studies. However, some evidence for growth improvement was observed when these residuals were added to sandy soils of a fiatwoods site. We observed little short-term growth benefit from incorporation of inorganic causticizing residues or ash in either the greenhouse study or in field studies of pine plantation establishment. Recycling pulp mill wastewater treatment residuals and process residues to forestland may be a viable recycling/reuse alternative, but growth responses will vary among materials and soil types and are relatively small. Secondary wastewater treatment residuals have the greatest potential to improve growth, but current silvicultural operations would need to be adapted to effectively use these materials. FOR.

Our aim was to test if ash induced decomposition activity was associated with enhanced turnover of recalcitrant, i.e. relatively old, organic pools. Two experiments were conducted in the same coniferous plantation after the application of 0, 3, 4.5 and 6 t ash ha−1, and 0, 3, 9, 15 and 30 t ash ha−1, respectively. We used natural abundance of 15N in mosses, mites and ectomycorrhizal fungi 26 months after ash application, as well as temporal variation in δ15N values of ectomycorrhizal fungi, as an indicator of decomposition of recalcitrant organic matter in the ﬁrst experiment. Furthermore, in the second experiment we used measurements of extracellular manganese peroxidase activity almost 4 years after ash application as an indication of potential decomposition of lignin, an important component of recalcitrant organic matter.",

In the first experiment, ash particle residues were extracted from peat and mineral soils 3 and 5 years after spreading and analysed for changes in element concentrations. Dissolution of different ash fertilizer products was also estimated by measuring the changes over time in the recovery of added nutrients and heavy metals in the surface of two peat soils. The results showed that potassium (K), sodium (Na), boron and sulfur are easily released from wood ash, whereas heavy metals are highly insoluble in all types of ash fertilizer products. Granulated ash fertilizers were less soluble than powdered fertilizers and the products stabilized by self-hardening. Minor differences occurred in ash fertilizer dissolution between peat and mineral soils and soils of different fertility. The most significant difference between wood and peat ash concerning their dissolution was the low solubility of K and Na in peat ash. Given the very slow dissolution of ash fertilizers, long-term studies are needed to understand fully the effect of ash fertilization on nutrient and heavy metal cycling in forest ecosystems.",

However, it has been shown that use of calcium phosphate fertilizers generally lead to highly increased P release to recipient water courses. On the other hand, no corresponding release has been reported after ash fertilization. Soil samples from the surface peats from a nutrient poor and a fertile drained peatland site were collected before and 1–4 years after application of five different types of ash products. The changes over time in the different chemical forms of P in the substrate were studied. The results indicated that the reason for the low liability to leaching of ash fertilizers was that significant amounts of P are adsorbed by Al and Fe during weathering of the ash fertilizers. However, further studies are needed to clarify whether the adsorption of P occurs with the Al and Fe of the ash or the native Al and Fe compounds present in soil before ash fertilization.",

		"abstract": "The interactive effects of site preparation (spot mounding) and fertilization (granulated wood ash) on soil properties, soil micro- and mesofauna and ground vegetation were studied in two Norway spruce plantations established in clear-cut forests in Central Finland. Half of the seedlings were planted on mounds created by the planting machine, and the rest on intact forest ﬂoor. Half of the seedlings on mounded and intact forest ﬂoor were fertilized by adding granulated wood ash to circular plots surrounding the seedlings. Initial samples were taken from mounded and intact soil immediately after planting in June. Samples were taken from all treated plots in the autumn in the ﬁrst and the second year after the treatments. Wood ash increased soil moisture percentage, the abundances of collembolans and mites, the biomass of enchytraeid populations, the pool size of water-extractable NH4-N in soil and the N concentration of spruce needles. Spot mounding had little immediate effects, but increased the proportion and abundance of bacterial-feeding nematodes later on. In the second year, spot mounding increased NH4-N in organic soil and N concentration of the spruce needles, and reduced pH irrespective of wood ash addition. In accordance with general disturbance theories, our plots, particularly those disturbed by spot mounding, were characterized by bacterial-based food chains, and increased availability of inorganic N. The ash effects on soil organisms and nitrogen availability were better explained by increased soil moisture than by pH and conductivity, suggesting that the ash granules acted as inorganic mulch. Both wood ash and, in particular, spot mounding have the potential to increase N leaching locally. However, spot mounding may be preferable to other site preparation methods, because this method disturbs a smaller area of soil.",

		"abstract": "Afforestation is one of many different ways to reclaim cutover peatland areas . Among the treatments often required to obtain successful afforestation are supplementary drainage, fertilization and rotovation . This study presents the effects of drainage and wood-ash fertilization on the chemical composition of water in a cutaver peatland area, which constitutes 34 hectares of a minerotrophic mire in SW Sweden . Fourteen hectares of the cutover peatland was amended with 23 tonnes of wood ash, 0 .4 tonnes of raw phosphate and 0 .25 tonnes of superphosphate per hectare, while different doses of a PK-fertilizer were applied on the remaining 20 hectares . The chemical properties of groundwater and stream water in the wood-ash amended area were compared with those in the PK-fertilized area and a control area. Outflowing groundwater emanating from the mineral subsoil affected the chemical composition of peat groundwater and streamwater. Drainage changed chemical composition more than the wood ash fertilization . Drainage led to increases in SO4 and decreases in alkalinity in both peat groundwater and in stream water . The pH decreased in peat groundwater, whereas the streamwater pH was not affected because the high alkalinity in the mineral soil groundwater buffered the acid peat groundwater. Fertilization increased contents of K, Ca and Mn in both peat groundwater and stream water . Contents of B, o-P and Tot-P increased in peat groundwater but not in stream water, whereas the reverse was true for Mg . The outflow of P did not increase in spite of the large amount of P applied . The high retention of P was caused by large quantities of sesquioxides, especially Fe-oxides in the peat .",

This paper covers examples of case studies carried out at the mill and describes how the wastes and by-products are utilized as a neutralizing agent for acidic wastewaters (i.e., green liquor dregs from the causticizing process), as a hardener in ﬁlling mine cavities (i.e., ash from the ﬂuidized bed boiler), as a landscaping agent (i.e., ash as well as the ﬁbre clay from chemical wastewater treatment plant), as a hydraulic barrier material for landﬁlls (i.e., ﬁbre clay), and as a soil enrichment agent (i.e., calcium carbonate from the precipitated calcium carbonate plant). In addition, the wood waste from the wood-handling plant, sawmill, packaging pallet plant and from the groundwood mill, as well as the biosludge from the biological wastewater treatment plant, are all incinerated in the ﬂuidized bed boiler for energy production. Due to eﬀective utilization of the solid wastes generated at the mills, the annual amount of waste to be disposed of in the landﬁll has decreased between 1994 and 2004 from 42,990 to 6083 tonn (expressed as wet weight).

During the sampling period, when the bottom ash was sampled from the outlet of the boiler and the fly ash from the boilers electrostatic precipitator (ESP), approximately 97% or the energy produced by the BFB boiler originated from the incineration of clean forest residues (i.e. bark, woodchips and sawdust), and 3% from the incineration of sludge from the primary clarifier of a wastewater treatment plant.

Consequently, knowledge about the material fluxes of inorganic elements and compounds during biomass combustion for different kinds of biofuels and their influencing variables is of great importance. The results gained will especially influence the future design and control of biomass furnaces and boilers in order to prevent slagging, fouling and corrosion and to assist in the definition of quality requirements for biofuels as well as the possibilities of a sustainable ash utilization. For this reason, comprehensive test runs were carried out in several biomass combustion plants equipped with different combustion technologies and using various biomass fuels (wood chips, bark, straw and cereals). During continuous observation periods of at least two days, samples of the biomass and the different ash fractions were taken and analysed. Furthermore, the most important operating data of the plants were recorded.",

		"abstract": "In Sweden, large-scale recycling of wood ash to forests is considered a means of replenishing base cations, particularly Ca, taken up by the trees and removed by logging. To minimize negative effects on the forest ecosystem, slow rates of dissolution of the ash and release of Ca would be preferred. Carbonation of wetted ash [Ca(OH)2] can reduce the rate of Ca dissolution. In this study, field experiments were performed to evaluate carbonation of ash following application to forest soil beneath a spruce [Picea abies (L.) Karst] stand. To accomplish this, a mass spectrometric analytical method was developed that allowed quantitative estimation and isotopic analysis of the ash carbonate concentration. The dynamic range was between 0.07 and 30 ␮mol of carbonate, measured as CO2 evolved from an acidulated ash sample, which corresponded with between 0.01 and 5 mg of a completely carbonated ash (dried) containing ≈0.30 g gϪ1 Ca. The method allowed spatially resolved measurements (≈1 mm3) of the amount of carbonate and the 13C/12C and 18O/16O isotopic ratios. Following field application, ash granules (8–11 mm o.d.) increased their degree of carbonation from ≈45 to Ͼ80% within 3 d and were Ͼ90% carbonated after 3 wk. For the initial 3 d, the rate of carbonation, Rc, was estimated to be 0.70 (Ϯ 0.33) ␮mol mgϪ1 dϪ1 carbonate. During the field carbonation process, the outer granule layer could either be enriched or depleted in carbonate relative to the interior parts, which is suggested to depend on the occurrence of rainfall. These results indicate that the rate of carbonation of ash granule Ca in the field is rapid and probably dominates over Ca dissolution, especially under favorable conditions.",

		"abstract": "Wood ash is a residual material produced at an annual rate of 1.5-3.0 million tons by wood burning power plants in the USA. Up to 80% of the wood ash generated in northeastern USA is landspread on agricultural soils. Recently, concern has arisen regarding the t37Cs content of wood ash and levels of 137Cs of wood ash-amended soils. The 137Cs originated primarily from above ground nuclear weapons testing in the 1950s and 1960s. This study examined the total and pH 3, NI\"I4OAcextractable levels of 137Csand 4°K in three soils incubated in the laboratory with 0, 3 and 9 g of wood ash on a calcium carbonate equivalence basis kg -1 soil. The wood ash contained 137Cs and 4°K at 3920 and 21700 pCi kg -1, respectively. At the regulated wood ash application rate limit, 3 g wood ash (calcium carbonate equivalent basis) kg-1 of soil, there was no statistical difference from the control treatment in both total and soluble 137Cs and 4°K levels. For one soil, there was an increase in the 137Cs level when wood ash was amended at 9 g wood ash (calcium carbonate equivalent basis) kg -~ soil. The 137Cswas strongly bound to the cation exchange sites of the soils with the average fraction soluble in pH 3, NH4OAc solution at 4.8% in the mineral soils and 0.9% in the organic soil. Considering the current limits on permitted wood ash application rates to soils, there was no statistically significant effect on the levels of 137Cs or 4°K found in wood ash-amended soils.",

Although wood ash generally contains low levels of trace metals, release of some of these may occur soon after ash application in acid soils. The risk of heavy metal contamination associated with application of mixed wood ash was assessed in six Pinus radiata D. Don plantations, on two types of mineral soil differing in texture, drainage and CECe. Four of the stands received a single application of 4500 kg ha−1 (March 2003), and in the other two stands the same treatment was applied over three consecutive years (2003–2005). Trace metal (Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, Zn) concentrations were monitored throughout the 3 years in different components of the forest ecosystem—soil solid fraction, soil solution, tree needles, ground vegetation and different mushroom species. Repeated applications of wood ash led to moderate increases in soil extractable Mn and Zn, and Mn in all mushrooms species. However, the maximum concentrations did not reach levels potentially harmful to organisms. Concentrations of Zn, Cu and Cd decreased in some mushroom species, probably because of increased soil pH caused by the treatment. Heavy metal concentrations in tree needles and ground vegetation were not altered. Although the risk of heavy metal contamination appears to be low, the long-term effects of wood ash application must be assessed.",

The accumulation and distributions of, and interaction between, Ca and heavy metals in wood and bark of two-year-old Norway spruce (Picea abies [L.] Karst.) were investigated in this study. The treatment was carried out for 3 months in nutrient solutions, and there was a low or a high addition of Ca, Cd, Cu or Zn. The metal accumulation in, and distribution between, the bark, the wood formed during the treatment period (new wood), and the wood formed before the treatment period (old wood) was analyzed with AAS. The contents of the metals in the stems (i.e., bark, new wood, old wood) increased with elevated addition of the metal in question, also at the low addition of Ca, Cu, and Zn. Interactions between Ca and the heavy metals were found. Elevated Ca additions decreased the Cd content of the bark and the Zn content of the old wood, and tended to decrease the Cu content of the bark and the Cd content of the old wood. The Ca content decreased in both, wood and bark after Cu addition and the high Cd addition. Thus, even small changes in metal availability and proportions in forest soil, such as after spreading of wood ashes in the forest, will be reflected in the content of the metals in the wood and bark of forest trees.",

Changes in the metal content of wood and bark of young spruce trees were found 3 and 6 years after spreading pellets of ash or ash+GLD compared with the control. The effect of the treatments on the metal contents of bark and wood differed and was larger after 3 years than after 6 years. Treatment with ash+GLD tended to have less effect on the metal contents of bark and wood than treatment with only ash. An increase in the contents of Cu and Zn in bark or wood, compared with the control, was only found for the ash treatment and only 3 years after application. Both the ash and ash+GLD treatment decreased the Cd content of the wood and/or bark after 3 years, and after 6 years it still was, or tended to be, lower than the control.",

Mill.) stands showing symptoms of tree decline or foliar chlorosis in boreal forests of eastern Laurentian Highlands in Quebec, Canada. In the ﬁrst trial, trees showed strong decline symptoms; fertilization treatments consisted of combinations of two nutrients among N, K, and Mg, each at two rates. In the second trial, trees showed some needle chlorosis; various doses of N, K, K–Mg, and K-lime fertilizers were applied. In both trials, N fertilization (200 kg N haÀ1) resulted only in a short-term (2–3 years) increase in foliar N concentrations and radial growth. Potassium fertilization (100–400 kg K2O haÀ1), however, led to an increase of at least 33% in both foliar K concentrations and radial growth, which lasted for the duration of the experiments (7–11 years). Liming (1–4 t dolomitic lime haÀ1) increased the pH, exchangeable calcium and exchangeable magnesium in the humus and top mineral soil horizons, but did not inﬂuence balsam ﬁr foliar nutrient status or growth. Tree defoliation rate was mainly related to growth decrease and foliar K concentrations. The trials also show that K was the most limiting nutrient for balsam ﬁr growth, and that the poor K nutrient status and vigor of balsam ﬁr trees can be corrected by K fertilization. These results contrast with past fertilization studies that generally reported N as the most limiting nutrient in these boreal ecosystems. Climatic events may have also played a role in triggering the decline of balsam ﬁr in one trial.",

The experiment was established in a 38-yearold Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) stand on Arenosols in Central Lithuania in 2002. Five months (ﬁfteen months for soil solution) and two years after wood ash application, control plots and plots treated with 5 t of wood ash ha–1 were compared with regard to heavy metal concentrations of the O horizon, mineral topsoil (0–5 cm), soil solution (20 and 50 cm depth), the dominant species of the ground vegetation (Pleurozium schreberi) and current and ﬁrst year needles of Scots pine. The clearest effect was found for the O horizon and the Scots pine needles. The concentrations of Cr, Cu, Ni and Zn in the O horizon and the concentrations of Cr, Cu and Ni in the Scots pine needles were signiﬁcantly higher in the fertilised plots. Results showed that most of the metals were bound in the O horizon, therefore signiﬁcant downward transport was determined only for Zn and Ni 2 years after treatment. No ash inﬂuence on the leaching of other metals was found. The chemical composition of P. schreberi was not affected by ash fertilisation. Despite the increase of Cd, Pb and Zn concentrations in the current year needles, tendencies of decreased Ni and Cu concentrations were observed.",

Wood ash can be applied to energy crops as a fertilizer, which can help replace nutrients removed during harvest. The objectives of this study were to examine the temporal and spatial dynamics of nutrient elements applied in wood ash to an intensively cultured, short-rotation willow bioenergy system. Wood ash was applied at the rates of 10 and 20 Mg ha−1 yr−1 to coppiced willow, Salix purpurea, clone SP3, from 1992 to 1994. The relative abundance of nutrients in applied wood ash was Ca > K > Mg > P > N. There was little effect of wood ash on N or P concentrations in soil solution measured at 20 and 40 cm depth. Soil solution concentrations of base cations were elevated in the last two years of the study by 30 to 90%, depending on the element and treatment, in plots receiving wood ash. Wood ash treatments had little inﬂuence on foliar leaching. Wood ash treatment also had few signiﬁcant effects on willow growth or on the contents of N, P, K, Ca, and Mg in foliage and stems. The addition of P, K, Ca, and Mg in wood ash was more than enough to compensate for harvest removals and leaching losses. This study demonstrated that wood ash can supply most nutrients removed during harvest in willow plantations, with the exception of N, without adverse effects on groundwater or vegetation.",

We tested whether wood ash generated when burning wood for energy could be used to ameliorate negative soil effects of shortrotation harvesting practices. We measured the temporal and spatial dynamics of soil nutrient properties after wood ash applications in a willow plantation in central New York State and determined the inﬂuence of wood ash application on willow growth. Wood ash was applied annually for 3 years at the rates of 10 and 20 Mg haÀ1 to coppiced willow, Salix purpurea, clone SP3. Wood ash application signiﬁcantly increased soil pH in the 0–10 cm soil layer from 6.1 in the control to 6.9 and 7.1 in the 10 and 20 Mg haÀ1 treated plots. Wood ash application signiﬁcantly increased soil extractable phosphorus, potassium, calcium, and magnesium concentrations. Potassium was the element most affected by wood ash treatment at all soil depths. Wood ash had no signiﬁcant effect on nutrient concentrations of foliar, litter, and stem tissue. Wood ash did not affect either individual plant growth or plot biomass production, which declined over the course of the study; it did increase the size of stems, but this effect was balanced by a decrease in the number of stems. Applying nitrogen as well as wood ash might be required to maintain the productivity of this SRIC system.",

The study revealed no clear response of the litter decomposition to wood ash application after four years. The biomasses of soil organic matter in the treated plots and control did not differ signiﬁcantly. Contrary to the expected results the biomass of the organic matter was greater in both ash treated plots than in the control plot.

		"abstract": "Wood ash contains all the essential plant nutrients except nitrogen, and thus supports tree growth especially on peatlands where mineral nutrients often are in short supply. Here we report the effects of wood ash fertilization on the soil microbial community in a boreal drained peatland, characterized by phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) composition, and more speciﬁcally the fungal community, characterized with PCR-DGGE ﬁngerprinting and sequencing methods. We investigated the microbial communities in unfertilized and ash-fertilized sample plots (loose wood ash 5000 or 15 000 kg haÀ1) 6 years after fertilization. Microbial function measured as heterotrophic basal respiration increased over 30% in the surface peat layer after wood ash fertilization, yet the result was statistically insigniﬁcant. The higher amount of wood ash induced a shift in the microbial community in the surface peat layer (0e10 cm) along with an increase in pH. A higher relative proportion of fungal-speciﬁc PLFA 18:2u6 and an increased fungal:bacterial ratio indicated that fungi beneﬁted from the higher amount of wood ash in the topmost layer. Also, the lower amount of wood ash seemed to have stimulated actinobacteria. Our results indicated that higher pH and extra nutrients due to wood ash fertilization promoted the appearance of mycorrhizal and wood-decomposing fungi directly or via increased tree growth. We suggest that wood ash as a fertilizer would be a natural and economical choice to improve the nutrient status of drained peatlands used for forestry since it maintains the positive feedback between fungi and trees.",

A ﬁeld experiment, which included 3 treatments and 4 replicate blocks, was established on an acidic, organic matter-rich mineral soil. The treatments were two different doses of ash (10 and 20 t ha-1) and an unfertilized control. Application of the ash (by spreading on the ground) produced mean increases of 16% in diameter and 11% in height growth of trees during the ﬁrst 3 years, considering both doses together; the response was also signiﬁcant for the subsequent period, particularly with the higher dose of ash (increases of 11% in diameter and 15% in height growth). The ash had a marked effect, although clearly short lived, on pH (H2O) levels (an increase of 0.6 units) and on exchangeable soil K, Ca and Mg. The nutritional status of the plantation was improved, mainly in terms of K, Ca and Mg, and the results of a vector analysis indicated that these elements, particularly K, were limiting forest production. Foliar or soil nutrient concentrations in the mineral soil were no longer affected by the ash at age 12 years. We recommend the application of two doses of 10 Mg ha-1 throughout the rotation for fertilizing acid mineral soils that are rich in organic matter.",

The experiment was performed using two fertilization levels (3 and 9 t ash ha21) and repeated in two coniferous forest stands of different site fertility. It was hypothesized that the effects of hardened wood ash on soil microbes are of less magnitude when compared to loose ash due to the slower dissolution rates. The long-term effects of loose ash (3 t ash ha21) were studied in four forest stands of different site fertility 18 years after ash application. In order to study ash effects, the microbial activity (basal respiration- and thymidine incorporation rates) and microbial community structure (PLFA pattern) were determined. The results showed that irrespective of the forest site fertility, ash fertilization induced the same responses in the humus layer. It raised the microbial activity and changed the community structure. The changes were related to the dose and form of ash applied. Applying the same fertilization rate induced comparatively more changes to the loose wood ash sites than hardened wood ash sites, due to the detected slower dissolution of hardened ash into the humus. The effects of wood ash were long-term. Changes in the humus microbial activity and PLFA pattern were still detectable after 18 years. q 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",

It has been shown that spiking ash with Cd to concentrations of 1000 mg kg31 induced no further changes in humus microbial activity and community structure as ash alone. To accelerate the weathering process and thus to liberate the spiked Cd from the ash, three treatments ^ wood ash (A), Cd spiked wood ash (ACd, 1000 mg Cd kg31 ash), both applied at a fertilization rate of 5000 kg ha31, together with a control (C) ^ were performed in microcosms and incubated in field condition under two types of irrigation ^ water and simulated acid rain. During the incubation period of one growing season the simulated acid rain plots received a sulfur load of 3.64 g S m32, which was 15 times more than the S deposition on the water irrigated plots. The treatments resulted in a mean Cd increase of the humus from 0.23 mg kg31 of the C treatment to 0.52 and 39.5 mg kg31 of the A and ACd treatments, respectively. The irrigation had no further effect on the result. The microbial activity, measured as soil basal respiration, and the microbial community structure, measured as humus phospholipid fatty acid and 16S and 18S polymerase chain reaction/denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis patterns, changed only due to the ash (A and ACd treatments) fertilization irrespective of the irrigation. The bacterial biosensor, emitting light in the presence of bioavailable Cd, did not react to any of the treatments. This result shows that Cd in ash was not leached into the humus due to increased deposition of acidified rain.",

Therefore, the objectives of this field study were to test if the Cd of wood ash has the potential to affect the coniferous forest humus microflora and if Cd enters the human food chain. These objectives were tested with ash (A) and Cd-spiked ash (ACd, 400 mg Cd·kg–1) at a fertilization rate of 3 t·ha–1. Microbial community structure, respiration, needle litter decomposition, growth rates and Cd tolerance of bacteria, and the bioavailability of Cd were measured. Also, Cd concentrations of humus, soil percolation water, mushrooms, fruits and leaves of berries, and needles were determined. The amount of Cd in the percolation water or bioavailable Cd, measured with a bacterial biosensor, and Cd tolerance of bacteria did not increase, although the ACd treatment increased the amount of humus total and extractable Cd. Only the ACd and not the A treatment caused Cd concentration increment in Lactarius rufus and berries of Empetrum nigrum. In spite of the high Cd concentration of the spiked ash, it did not have harmful effects on humus microorganisms during this 4-year study. Thus, wood ash is safe to use as a fertilizer in forests.",

Microbial community structure was determined by phospholipid fatty acid analysis, which mainly targets bacteria. Fungal community structure was assessed by 18S rDNA-targeted polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis. The bioavailability of Cu was tested with the Pseudomonas ﬂuorescens DF57-Cu15 reporter strain, which bioluminescences in the presence of Cu. Our ﬁeld study showed, that acid and metal treatments both changed the humus layer microbial community structure. Acid application decreased humus layer pH and base saturation (BS) and increased the amounts of both extractable and bioavailable Cu. Metal application increased the concentration of extractable Ni and changed the fungal community structure. In irrigated laboratory microcosms the abovementioned treatment effects were still seen except for the acid and metal effects on microbial and fungal community structures. For ashtreated microcosms, neither acid nor metal effects were found for humus layer pH, BS, extractable Cu and Ni, or bioavailable Cu. Thus, wood ash can be used for remediation of acid and metal polluted humus.",

		"abstract": "Environmental policies of the European Union (EU) aim to increase the amount of renewable energy and to improve the use of waste streams. This will increase the amount of ﬂy ash (FA) from biomass combustion, thereby increasing the need for its utilization. Biomass FA is a good fertilizer since it contains most of the nutrients that plants need. Sequential leaching would provide a more accurate assessment of the potential bioavailability of the harmful elements and nutrients than the pseudo-total and/or watersoluble concentration analysis that EU environmental legislation typically requires. This study investigated the effect of granulation and ammonium sulfate addition on the solubility and bioavailability of nutrients and harmful elements from peat and wood co-combustion FA by using sequential leaching and pseudo-total acid digestion. The recoveries of the easily bioavailable nutrients Ca, K, Mg, P, and S as well as the total bioavailability of Ca, K, Mg, and S reduced signiﬁcantly after granulation. Therefore, granulation reduced the fertilizing effect of FA. The pseudo-total recovery of Ca, Mg, and S reduced after granulation, indicating that these types of FA form some very stable silicate compounds besides the common self-hardening products. Ammonium sulfate addition increased the recoveries of the easily bioavailable nutrients and total bioavailability recoveries of the Ca, K, and Mg back to the same levels as those in FA. The total bioavailability of the harmful elements As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn was very low, and this does not limit the usability of FA as a fertilizer.",

However, a simple and fast method of determining the distribution of the ash and the extent of affected soil is missing. In this study we present the use of magnetic susceptibility, which is controlled by Fe-oxides, in comparing the fertilized soil in the forest plantation of pine and oak with intact forest soil. Spatial and vertical distribution of magnetic susceptibility was measured in an oak and pine plantation next to stems of young plants, where wood ash was applied as fertilizer. Pattern of the susceptibility distribution was compared with that in non-fertilized part of the plantation as well as with a spot of intact natural forest soil nearby. Our results show that the wood-ash samples contain signiﬁcant amount of ferrimagnetic magnetite with susceptibility higher than that of typical forest soil. Clear differences were observed between magnetic susceptibility of furrows and ridges. Moreover, the dispersed ash remains practically on the surface, does not penetrate to deeper layers. Finally, our data suggest signiﬁcant differences in surface values between the pine and oak plants. Based on this study we may conclude that magnetic susceptibility may represent a simple and approximate method of assessing the extent of soil affected by wood-ash.",

		"abstract": "The increasing use of wood and peat in energy production has created a potential to utilize wood and peat ashes as forest fertilizers on a wide scale. Previous studies have shown that tree growth in peatland beneﬁts most from ash fertilization. However, possible harmful effects on recipient watercourses have prevented any larger-scale fertilization activity. The objective of this study was to examine the long-term changes in runoff acidity and the transport of nutrients, heavy metals and dissolved organic carbon via drainage water from drained boreal peatland catchments fertilized with wood or peat ash. The hypotheses were that the site’s peat type, the origin and formula of the ash and the time of application have an inﬂuence on leaching amounts. Therefore, the studied catchments represented different peat (Carex or Sphagnum) and site types with different standing tree stocks (8–127 m3 haÀ1). Loose, self-hardened and drum-granulated ashes (wood and peat ashes) were used and applied (5000–6500 kg haÀ1) either in winter on snow or in summer on bare ground. Water samples from the runoff were taken over a 10–11-year period following the applications. After 10–11 years from the treatments, the concentrations of S, K, Na, ClÀ, and Mg in the runoff water were still higher at the wood ash treatments compared to the controls. Leaching of elements from peat ash was lower than from wood ash due to the lower content of elements. We estimated that 15–52% of the added S and 2–28% of the added K were leached from the wood and peat ashes during the study period. Leaching of S was the highest after the winter application and higher from the Sphagnum than from the Carex peat dominated catchments. The leaching of K was the highest after the summer application and was the lowest from the catchments having the highest tree stock. No increased leaching of P, N, dissolved organic carbon or heavy metals was detected.",

Plant establishment and survival in highly metal-contaminated soils are crucial for phytostabilisation success, as metal toxicity for plants is widely reported. A relevant phytostabilisation solution must limit metal transfer through the food chain. Therefore, this study aimed at evaluating the long-term efﬁciency of aided phytostabilisation on former agricultural soils highly contaminated by cadmium, lead, and zinc. The inﬂuence of afforestation and ﬂy ash amendments on reducing metal phytoavailability was investigated as were their effects on plant development. Before being planted with a tree mix, the site was divided into three plots: a reference plot with no amendment, a plot amended with silico-aluminous ﬂy ash and one with sulfo-calcic ﬂy ash. Unlike Salix alba and Quercus robur, Alnus glutinosa, Acer pseudoplatanus and Robinia pseudoacacia grew well on the site and accumulated, overall, quite low concentrations of metals in their leaves and young twigs. This suggests that these three species have an excluder phenotype for Cd, Zn and Pb. After 8 years, metal availability to A. glutinosa, A. pseudoplatanus and R. pseudoacacia, and translocation to their above-ground parts, strongly decreased in ﬂy ash-amended soils. Such decreases ﬁt well together with the depletion of CaCl2-extractable metals in amended soils. Although both ﬂy ashes were effective to decrease Cd, Pb and Zn concentrations in above-ground parts of trees, the sulfo-calcic ash was more efﬁcient.",

Although the metals were extractable in all fractions, the highest concentrations of most of the metals occurred in the residual fraction. This fraction is the non-mobile fraction and is potentially the least harmful. The concentration of easily soluble Ca (24.5 g kg-1 (d.w.) in the fly ash was ca. 15 times higher than the typical value of 1.6 g kg-1 (d.w.) in arable land in Central Finland indicating that the fly ash is a potential agent for soil remediation and improving soil fertility. Both types of ash were alkaline (pH ~ 9.4 – 9.7), which means that they have a pH - buffering capacity. According to the Finnish legislation, both types of ash can be used as a fertilizer in the forest. This paper covers also examples how ashes are utilized in some Finnish pulp and paper mills.",

These limit values are applied if ash is utilized, e.g. in roads, cycling paths, pavements, car parks, sport ﬁelds, etc. In this study we have determined the most important chemical and physical properties of the cyclone ﬂy ash originating from the grate-ﬁred boiler incinerating forest residues (i.e. wood chips, sawdust and bark) at a small municipal district heating plant (6 MW), Northern Finland. This study clearly shows that elements are enriched in cyclone ﬂy ash, since the total element concentrations in the cyclone ﬂy ash were within 0.2–10 times higher than those in the bottom ash. The total concentrations of Cd (25 mg kg−1; d.w.), Zn (3630 mg kg−1; d.w.), Ba (4260 mg kg−1; d.w.) and Hg (1.7 mg kg−1; d.w.) exceeded the limit values, and therefore the cyclone ﬂy ash cannot be used as an earth construction agent. According to the leached amounts of Cr (38 mg kg−1; d.w.), Zn (51 mg kg−1; d.w.) and sulphate (50,000 mg kg−1; d.w.), the cyclone ﬂy ash is classiﬁed as a hazardous waste, and it has to be deposited in a hazardous waste landﬁll.",

These factors are leading to extensive job losses in Ontario’s north as well as rural community upheaval. Governments are striving to reverse these effects by stimulating new industries focused on using forest biofibre for products such as fuel for energy, specialty chemicals, and polymers. In light of these new demands, provincial and federal policy and science experts are examining the range of potential forest biomass utilization opportunities in terms of their long-term implications for sustainability, role in an emerging bioeconomy, and the possible influences of, for example, a changing climate and technological advances. Current research and broad-scale monitoring projects are helping to answer several important questions in the ecological, economic, policy, resource supply, and technological realms, while new questions must be continually addressed. In this paper, we describe the legislative, policy, and administrative context in which the sustainable biofibre industry may exist. We argue that social, economic, and environmental goals for a sustainable forest biofibre industry in Ontario can best be achieved by adhering to the principles of adaptive management. Market forces and third-party certification, which can influence the biofibre sector, are also discussed.",

Can. J. Soil Sci. 94: 621Á634. Wood ash is produced in large quantities in Canada as a by-product of the pulp and paper, sawmill, and bioenergy industries and it is anticipated that its disposal in landfills will not be a viable option. An alternative option may be to use it to amend forest soils. Wood ash is a complex mixture and its composition depends on several variables, including the combustion parameters of the boiler in which it is generated. We present an analysis of the amendment of two Canadian forest soils (a Brunisol from the Great LakesÁSt. Lawrence and a Luvisol from the Carolinian forest regions of Ontario) with six different wood ashes collected from different biomass boilers through short-term controlled incubations. We show that following an 8-wk incubation period, amendment of the soils with wood ash led to small to moderate increases in soil pH, but had little effect on soil microbial activity and biomass. The concentration of important base cations such as calcium, magnesium and potassium as well as phosphorus generally increased in both soil types following amendment with different ash. This practice can return nutrients lost from forest ecosystems during harvesting; however, effects were found to be boiler-specific. Lastly, we show that four ash types led to small increases in cadmium in either soil; the concentration of all other measured heavy metals was not significantly increased following amendment, and in certain cases decreased, particularly with lead. The only potentially negative aspect encountered was elevated sodium, particularly with ash from one boiler, but unacceptable Na-absorptivity ratios were not exceeded. These results demonstrate that with proper characterization and selection of wood ash type and application rates, amendment of Canadian forest soils with wood ash may benefit forest ecosystems and is unlikely to disrupt the chemical and biological processes in soil environments.",

Spatial distribution of biomass, necromass and morphology parameters of the ﬁne roots (diameter classes <1, 1–2, <2 mm) of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) were analysed in response to fertilisation with granulated wood ash (GWA) in a long-term ﬁeld experiment in SW Sweden. GWA was applied as a single dose of 3200 kg haÀ1 and the ﬁne roots were sampled 9 years later by soil coring. Soil cores were divided into 1-cm strata within the top 0–2.5 cm humus limits, the lower humus below 2.5 cm (with varying thickness) and the mineral soil to 50 cm depth (from ground surface). Total ﬁne-root biomass in the control (C) and GWA treatment, 256 Æ 20 and 258 Æ 25 g mÀ2, respectively, and length 2072 Æ 182 and 1800 Æ 198 m mÀ2, respectively, did not differ statistically from each other. Total ﬁne-root necromass in the 1–2 mm fraction was signiﬁcantly higher in C than in the GWA treatment, 130 Æ 12 and 80 Æ 10 g mÀ2, respectively. Fine-root biomass in the <1 mm fraction was signiﬁcantly greater in the lower humus in the GWA treatment, but this did not affect the total biomass in the <1 mm fraction in the whole soil proﬁle. The biomass-to-necromass ratio (1–2 mm) was signiﬁcantly higher in the GWA treatment in the 0–30 cm soil layer than in the corresponding layer of the control. Speciﬁc root length (SRL) was lower in the GWA treatment than in the control in the 0–5 cm soil layer. The lower necromass and SRL were more clearly related to the GWA treatment, whereas the difference in the vertical distribution of biomass may have been related to the thicker humus layer in the GWA plots.",

		"abstract": "Liming and wood-ash addition have long been used to attenuate the effects of acidic deposition on forest soils with the goal of promoting tree growth. We performed quantitative meta-analyses of treatment studies from managed forest ecosystems to assess general tendencies of effects of treatment on seven selected measures of performance thought to reasonably reﬂect the effects of Ca-addition treatment. We retrieved over 350 independent trials from 110 peer-reviewed liming and wood-ash addition studies that were integrated to determine soil pH, base saturation (BS), tree foliar Ca concentration, tree growth, ectomychorrhizae root colonization, soil C-to-N ratio, and microbial indices. The results were quantiﬁed through three separate metaanalysis effect size metrics: unweighted relative values and two weighted metrics, Hedges' d and ln R. A surprising number of treatment trials (22%–85%) reported no signiﬁcant effect, and soil pH and foliar Ca appeared more responsive to liming than to wood-ash addition, whereas BS and tree growth appeared more responsive to wood-ash addition. For six of the seven parameters, estimated mean effect sizes were similar in magnitude and positive in direction for all three meta-analysis metrics. Regression tree optimal models explained 38% of the variation in pH, 47% of the variation in BS, 51% of the variation in foliar Ca concentration, and 26% of the variation in tree growth. The largest predictors of effect size, within our selected group, were as follows: soil type for pH; soil type, trial duration in years, and species (hardwood or softwood) for BS; treatment dose and type for foliar Ca concentration; and trial duration, initial soil pH, and tree species for tree growth. This analysis shows that Ca additions are not universally beneﬁcial and provides insight into when Ca additions to forest soils are likely to be most effective.",

		"abstract": "Production of wood ash has increased strongly in the last ten years due to the increasing popularity of renewable and CO2-neutral heat and energy production via wood burning. Wood ashes are rich in many essential plant nutrients. In addition they are alkaline. The idea of using the waste ash as fertiliser in forests is appealing. However, wood is also known for its ability to strongly enrich certain heavy metals from the underlying soils, e.g. Cd, without any anthropogenic input. Concentrations of 26 chemical elements (Ag, As, Au, B, Ba, Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, K, La, Mg, Mn, Mo, Na, Ni, P, Pb, S, Sb, Sr, Ti, and Zn) in 40 samples each of birch and spruce wood ashes collected along a 120 km long transect in southern Norway are reported. The observed maximum concentrations are 1.3 wt.% Pb, 4.4 wt.% Zn and 203 mg/kg Cd in birch wood ashes. Wood ashes can thus contain very high heavy metal concentrations. Spreading wood ashes in a forest is a major anthropogenic interference with the natural biogeochemical cycles. As with the use of sewage sludge in agriculture the use of wood ashes in forests clearly needs regulation.",

		"abstract": "Purpose This work aimed to study the effect of the application of biomass fly ash in the soil profile and percolate water, which is a novel feature. The results produced by this work pose a useful contribute for by-products’ valorization for the pulp and paper industry, namely fly ash and sludge, diverting them from landfills and achieving significant savings. Materials and methods Soil profiles (0.60 m) were collected in the field and into laboratory-scale vessels. Four soil profiles were used in this work. One of the profiles was used as control. To each of the other three, 7.5 Mg ha−1 of biomass fly ash, fly ash combined with sludge (50:50%wt.), or a conventional liming agent (CaO) were added. A simulation of the daily natural watering of the soils has been made throughout 1 month, with collection of the daily percolating from the bottom of the vessels. After this period, soil profiles were divided into three equal-sized depth layers (0.20 m each). Soil pH, electrical conductivity, and available Ca, Mg, K, P, Na, Mn, Fe, Zn, and Cu contents were determined in the three layers for each of the four soil profiles used. A parallel experiment was conducted in which additional pots of soil were prepared with the same amendment. Ryegrass (Lolium perenne) was sown in order to evaluate the effect on biomass growth and possible phytotoxicity.\nResults and discussion Amendment with biomass fly ash elevated soil pH slightly, to values within the most adequate range for plant growth. Results showed small raises in the availability of the essential plant macronutrients Ca, K, and Mg, especially in the top layer of the soils, where the amendment materials were applied. The mobilization of cations to the groundwater was always minimal, which is promising since it means little contamination to the groundwater. Ash and ash + sludge amendments produced similar plant growth results when compared to the control. However, biomass grown in Cao-amended pots showed the higher root size.\nConclusions Incorporation in the soil proved to be a viable way to manage fly ash and sludge from pulp and paper industry, which could mean considerable savings. The effect on soil fertilization was similar to the conventional liming agent. No obvious hazardous effect on the soil or groundwater was found.",

		"abstract": "Wood-ash applications have been proposed to promote the long-term sustainability of forest production at increased harvest intensities. Effects of wood-ash and nitrogen (N) application on soil-solution chemistry were studied for 9 years following application in a coniferous stand in Sweden. Crushed, self-hardened wood ash was applied at 3, 6, and 9 Mg·ha–1 alone, the lowest dosage both with and without 150 kg N·ha–1. Pelleted wood ash (3 Mg·ha–1) and N were also applied alone. The soil solution was sampled by suction cups at 50 cm depth. The crushed, self-hardened ash readily dissolved in water, as reflected in increased soil-solution concentrations of sodium and sulphate. Significant (p < 0.05) elevations were also found for potassium, calcium, aluminum, and total organic carbon. Vanadium, chromium, manganese, nickel, copper, zinc, arsenic, and lead were not significantly affected by the ash treatments, but cadmium tended to increase in the treatments with ash alone. From the fourth year onwards, the pH of the soil solution was lowered and the aluminum concentration raised in the plots given 9 Mg crushed ash·ha–1. Fertilization with N alone temporarily increased concentrations of inorganic N, cadmium, aluminum, and zinc and decreased the pH. The crushed ash generally had longer lasting effects than N fertilization.",

		"abstract": "The availability of phosphorus and potassium often limit growth of trees on well drained peatlands in the boreal region. Wood ash, which contains phosphorus and potassium, can be used for forest fertilization on peatlands or for nutrient compensation following intensive harvesting. This study was performed in order to investigate the effects on water chemistry of applying wood ash to a Pinus sylvestris L. stand on a drained peatland in southern Sweden. Runoff chemistry was monitored in the main ditch for one year before and three years after the application of self-hardened and crushed wood ash, applied at an average rate of 3.1×103 kg per hectare. In addition, groundwater was collected from the ash-treated peatland and from an adjacent reference peatland and chemically analysed. Shortly after woodash application, the concentrations of boron, calcium, potassium, lithium, magnesium, manganese and sulphate in the ditch water, and the electrical conductivity, all increased. Some variables showed elevated concentrations for a few months only, while pH and the concentrations of boron, potassium, lithium, magnesium, manganese, total phosphorus and silica were signiﬁcantly (p < 0.05) elevated over the last one and a half or two years of the study, compared to the reference period. The concentrations of iron, total sulphur and sulphate were lower during the last one and a half or two study years than in the reference period. Several trace metals and anions did not appear to be affected. In general, the effects detected in groundwater were consistent with those found in ditch water. Groundwater ﬂow through superﬁcial soil layers seems to have facilitated leaching.",

		"abstract": "In the future it may become common practice to return wood-ash to forest ecosystems in order to replenish nutrients removed when brash has been extracted as a source of bioenergy. Wood-ash contains most of the nutrients that are present in the brash before its removal and burning, with the important exception of nitrogen (N). In the present paper we report measurements of CO2 emissions and net N mineralisation in the humus layer and the upper 5 cm of mineral soil 12 years after the application of wood-ash to two study sites, representing different tree species, climatic conditions and N deposition histories. We hypothesized that application of wood-ash would increase both carbon (C) and net N mineralisation rates at Torup, an N-rich site with Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) in the south, whereas the net N mineralisation rates would not be affected at Vindeln, an N-poor site with Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) in the north, where a possible N-limitation would restrict any N mineralisation. The treatments, comprising additions of 0, 1, 3 or 6 Mg of granulated wood-ash ha−1, were applied in a randomised block design, replicated three times. Wood-ash from the same batch was used for all treatments at both sites. All factors were measured under laboratory conditions with controlled temperature and moisture levels. The potential CO2 emissions (kg ha−1 year−1 of CO2–C) at Torup were signiﬁcantly higher in the 3 and 6 Mg ha−1 treatments than in the control treatment, and the highest application resulted in an extra loss of 0.5 Mg ha−1 of soil C annually as compared to the control. No such differences were detected at Vindeln. The results suggest that wood-ash application can deplete soil organic C at locations with similar characteristics (N-rich soil, spruce dominated, warm climate) as at Torup in this study.",

		"abstract": "Zusammenfassung Addition of wood ash to acid soils will affect the soil chemistry of forests in a number of ways which were assessed for a pine stand in northern Germany. A field experiment was carried out in a fifty-year old pine stand on a sandy Podzol at Fuhrberg (Lüneburger Heide, Lower Saxony/Germany) which involved depositing wood ash (2.4 t ha±1) on the surface. Soil solution chemistry was investigated monthly at different depths for 24 months. Prior to and 19 months after the ash addition, exchangeable cations and amounts of heavy metals were determined at different depths. Two to four months after addition of wood ash, maximum mean concentrations in the soil solution of Ca were 240 mmol l±1 at 0 cm (surface of mineral soil) and 100 mmol l±1 at 100 cm and of K 980 mmol l±1 and 140 mmol l±1, respectively. The pH values in soil solutions dropped temporarily by 0.3 units at 0 and 10 cm depth. Nitrate concentrations increased at all depths and maximum mean concentration was 230 mmol l±1 at 100 cm. Concentrations of Pb and Cr in soil solution did not change significantly (p < 0.05) after ash addition. Concentrations of Cd and Zn increased significantly at some depths but stayed well below the legal limit for drinking water and below the limits given by the German recommendation for soil conservation. Nineteen months after ash addition, the cation exchange capacity (corrected for the release of cations from the ash) of the upper 6 cm of the organic layer was almost doubled and amounts of exchangeable Ca and Mg increased significantly in the upper 8 cm of the organic layer. Amounts of Zn were increased in the entire organic layer, but changes were significant only in the upper 4 cm. The results of this study suggest that ash from untreated wood (using modest additions) may be recommended for amelioration of forest soils.",

		"abstract": "Past land use change has converted vast areas of Northern peatland by drainage to agricultural or forested land. This change often reduces the greenhouse gas (GHG) sink strength of peatlands or turns them even from sinks to sources, which affects the global climate. Therefore, there is a need for suitable mitigation options for GHG emissions from drained peatlands. Addition of wood ash to peatland forests has been suggested as such a measure, but the overall effect on the global warming potential (GWP) of these ecosystems is still unclear. In order to ﬁll this knowledge gap, we investigated three drained peatland forests in Sweden that had been fertilized with wood ash and monitored stand growth as well as the GHG emissions from soil, i.e. net efﬂuxes of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). Our results show that over the ﬁrst ﬁve to eight years after wood ash application, tree growth was enhanced at all sites. This was accompanied by generally little changes in the GHG emissions. Overall, we found that wood ash application reduced the GWP of drained peatland forests. Even though that our study was limited to eight years after wood ash application, we can conclude that in the short term wood ash application may be a suitable mitigation option for GHG emissions from Northern drained peatland forests.",

The treatments were an unfertilized control, a nitrogen treatment (N) and a combined treatment with N and three different doses of wood ash: 1, 2.5 and 5 Mg ash haÀ1 (WA1 + N, WA2.5 + N and WA5 + N). There were six replications in the control and N treatment and two replications in each ash + N treatment. The amount of N applied was 185 kg haÀ1. Compared to the control, the WA5 + N treatment signiﬁcantly increased the pH (0.5 pH units) and decreased the exchangeable acidity in soil (45%). The concentrations of exchangeable Ca, K and Mg in the soil in the WA2.5 + N and WA5 + N treatments and those of extractable P in all the wood ash + N treatments were signiﬁcantly higher than in the control and N-alone treatment. The Ca concentrations in the WA2.5 + N were two times and in the WA5 + N treatment three times that in the control treatment. The mean increment in basal area of the tree stand was signiﬁcantly higher in the WA1 + N and WA2.5 + N treatments than in the control or N-alone treatment during the 30-year study period. Although application of wood ash increased the growth response to N, at the end of the study period the response had virtually stopped. To compare the statistical signiﬁcance of the differences in microbial biomass and activities between different treatments, all six WA + N plots were combined, regardless of the different ash doses. Amounts of C and N in the microbial biomass, the rate of C mineralization (CO2 production) and concentration of K2SO4-extractable dissolved organic carbon were all higher in the WA + N treatment than in the N-alone treatment. The rate of net N mineralization, and the ratios between net N mineralization and C mineralization and between net N mineralization and microbial biomass N were all highest in the WA + N treatment, indicating better availability of N. In all treatments, however, both the rate of net nitriﬁcation and the NO3–N concentrations were negligible. In conclusion, wood ash application together with N seems to have very long-term effects on soil chemical properties and microbial processes in C and N cycling which give at least some explanations for the response in tree growth to this treatment.",

In Experiments 407 and 251 the responses of soil chemical properties and soil microbiological processes related to C and N cycling were also studied. The upland experiments included a control and a treatment with 3 Mg haÀ1 of wood ash. In Exp. 407, 120 kg N haÀ1 was applied together with ash; this experiment also included a treatment with N alone. The peatland experiment included a control and a treatment with 4.8 Mg haÀ1 of wood ash. All experiments had 3 replications. Wood ash signiﬁcantly decreased soil acidity on all sites. On the upland site, after 20 years, the concentration of K2SO4-extractable DOC and the rates of C mineralization (CO2–C production) and net N mineralization were all higher in the Ash + N treatment than in the control or N treatments. However, the treatments did not signiﬁcantly affect the amounts of C or N in the microbial biomass or the concentration of NH4–N. On the peatland site, after 27 years, ash stimulated C mineralization and cellulose decomposition, but microbial biomass C or N, net N mineralization or the concentration of N were not affected signiﬁcantly. On both the upland and peatland site, net nitriﬁcation was very low in all treatments. In Exp. 408, the volume growth in the control and Ash treatment was during the 20-year study period 60 and 64 m3 haÀ1, respectively, and in Exp. 402 108 and 120 m3 haÀ1, respectively, the latter difference being signiﬁcant. In Exp. 407, the volume growth in the Ash + N treatment was during the 20-year study period signiﬁcantly higher (92 m3 haÀ1) than in the N and control treatments (76 and 73 m3 haÀ1, respectively). On the peatland site during the 25-year study period the growth was 145 and 169 m3 haÀ1, in the control and Ash treatments, respectively. In conclusion, the long-term positive response of stem growth to wood ash on peatlands and N fertilized upland sites can be partly explained by changes in soil nutrient status and by microbial processes related to C and N cycling.",

Ca and Mg had intermediate solubility while P was less soluble in both water and acetic acid. The amount of hazardous substances having leached was low for most, but not all the ashes, in terms of Pb, Cr and As. Nevertheless, the phytoavailability of these hazardous substances after their application to the forest appeared low, due to their amphoteric leaching behavior and the acidity of Japanese forest soils.",

The seed and foliar samples for chemical analyses were collected during winters 1985–86 and 1988–89 from 39 grafts per clone fertilized in spring 1986. There were 6 clones and 13 treatments for each clone with three replications. The treatments consisted of N, P, K in various combinations, micronutrients, wood ash and grass control. Macro(N, P, K, Ca, Mg) and micronutrients (Cu, Zn, B) were analysed. There were statistically significant differences between the clones in seed nutrient concentrations. The variation of the K, Mg, Ca, Zn and Cu concentrations between the two study years was considerably larger in the seeds than in the needles. The concentrations of these elements in the seeds were low in the year of an abundant seed crop in spite of fertilization. This had, however, no negative effects on germination of seeds. The proportions of crude fat and crude protein were high in both years (34 % and 35 % in 1985 ; 33 % and 38 % in 1988). Fertilization had only minor or no effect at all on the seed chemical composition in the orchard with a satisfactory nutrient status of the soil. Also on the foliar nutrient concentrations the effect of the clone was stronger than that of fertilization. Grafts with large needles produced heavy seeds, which had more storage proteins than the lighter seeds.",

		"abstract": "The use of landfills as a disposal method for wood ash is costly, environmentally detrimental and is pitted against increasingly stern environmental regulations. Literature has shown that wood ash has the potential to be used as a forest fertiliser and the effects tend to be highly site-specific. Wood ash contains a combination of carbonates, hydroxides and other calcium-containing minerals that are responsible for the liming effect observed following application to soils. In addition, it contains significant magnesium and potassium concentrations, but little nitrogen and sulphur. The phosphorus availability of wood ash varies considerably and in effect can limit soil phosphorus uptake and may affect subsequent nutrient balance in plants. Short-rotation forestry practices and whole-tree harvest systems can induce periodic or persisting nutrient deficiencies and acidify the soil. This may affect the ability of a site to sustain adequate nutrient levels over successive rotations. Utilising wood ash as a soil amendment can offset or correct some nutrient deficiencies and imbalances induced by intensively managed plantation forests. This review covers the international literature on ash applications to forest land, including the effect of ash-beds remaining after slash burning (as a useful analogy for the effects of wood ash on soil properties and tree growth). The results show that ash applications to forest land can be done safely and can potentially stimulate microbial activity and improve pine and eucalypt growth. Safe ash application rates should be determined after consideration of (1) soil buffer capacity and ash alkalinity (expressed as calcium carbonate equivalence) and (2) an evaluation of the concentrations of heavy metals existing in soils and present in the available ash, particularly from cadmium, chromium, lead and arsenic.",

The trial consisted of wood ash treatments of 0, 0.3, 0.6 and 1.2 t ha-1, combined with fertilizer treatments of no fertilizer (control), 150 g tree-1 of conventional ammonium sulphate fertilizer or 320 g tree-1 of controlled release fertilizer mixture containing N, P and a balanced suite of several plant nutrients. The experiment was conducted on a young sandy soil of aeolian origin with a very low buffer capacity. Ash application rates were chosen after a pilot study was conducted to test the effect of CaCO3 on the soil reaction. At 4 and 8 months after treatment, soil heavy metal concentrations for cadmium (Cd), mercury (Hg), chromium (Cr) and lead (Pb) levels were substantially lower than toxic levels. Foliar heavy metal concentrations (for the same elements) were less than 1mg kg-1 at both time intervals. The wood ash induced a temporary liming effect up to 8 months after application. Foliar nutrient assessments revealed sub-optimal nutrient concentrations for phosphorous (P), potassium (K) and zinc (Zn) at 4 months and K at 8 months of age. The positive growth responses (expressed as a biomass index) at 8 months, ranged between 13% and 683% relative to the untreated control. At 21 months, the growth response to ash and fertilizer combinations ranged from -0.5% to 50% relative to the control. This research demonstrated that 1.2 t ha-1 of wood ash can safely be disposed of on a typical, poorly buffered Zululand coastal sand with little environmental risk and minimal growth suppression, provided that it is balanced with an appropriate NPS plus trace element fertilizer mixture.",

J. Plant Sci. 93: 1209Á1216. Wood ash has the potential to enhance productivity in agricultural systems by influencing soil pH and nutrient availability. The liming properties and fertility values of wood ash from three Atlantic wood ash sources were evaluated in this study. The liming properties were tested using three wood ash sources [JD Irving (IR), New Page (NP), and Brooklyn Power (BP)] and two local lime sources in an 8-mo incubation experiment at 258C. Soil pH was measured 14 times during the incubation. Availability of potassium (K) in wood ash was evaluated in a greenhouse setting with a K-deficient soil using annual ryegrass as the test plant. Total plant K and P uptake and Mehlich-3 extractable K and P were used as predictors of nutrient bioavailability. Wood ash application increased soil pH to the maximum level within the first 50 d after application and stabilized soil pH for 8 mo. The measured effective calcium carbonate equivalent of ashes relative to Mosher lime average among two soils were in order of BP (32) !IR (25)!NP (16). About 96, 38, and 71% of total K in IR, NP and BP ash sources, respectively, were bioavailable for ryegrass in 115 d. Although soil was not P deficient, soil P bioavailability (Mehlich III extractable P) was enhanced by 14 and 48% in NP and BP wood ash treatments, respectively, whereas P bioavailability decreased by 24% in the IR ash treatment. The results clearly demonstrate that these sources of wood ash can be considered as an effective liming agent and source of K in agricultural production systems.",

A randomized block design was used. Tree growth and concentrations of various elements in the needles were measured. The addition of similar doses of P (approx. 40 kg P ha–1) from different sources resulted in similar growth responses, amounting to 1.6–1.9 m3 ha–1 yr–1 of stem wood over the 26-year study. The P source was either wood ash (2500 kg d.w. ha–1) or PK-fertilizer (raw phosphate and potassium chloride). In response to several treatments there were both increased numbers of trees and increased growth of individual trees. The high PK-dose (40 kg P ha–1 and 80 kg K ha–1) appeared to result in a larger growth increase than the low dose (20 kg P ha–1 and 40 kg K ha–1). The N treatment had no additional effect on growth. In the control plots, tree growth was more or less negligible (0.04 m3 ha–1 yr–1). After almost 26 years, concentrations of P and K in the needles of treated plants were still higher than in the untreated control plants.

		"abstract": "Growing quantities of biomass ashes are currently produced worldwide due to the increasing consumption of biomass in energy applications. The disposal of biomass ash in landﬁlls is costly and leads to the loss of valuable resources. Biomass ash has important macro-nutrient contents and relevant soil liming capacity, and can be recycled to soils, thus contributing to biomass-to-energy process integration and a sustainable energy production. Although the EU Thematic Strategy for Soil Protection has highlighted the importance of promoting soil amelioration through nutrient recycling and some Member States have already recognised biomass-ash value in a context of circular economy, recycling of this material at the EU level and the potential use of ash-based material in fertilisers is still not properly framed by the EU regulatory framework. Adequate regulation for biomass ash from the energy sector is recognised of most importance as a driving force towards implementation of correct management and valorisation of ash as a raw material.",

A ﬁeld experiment, which included four treatments and four replicates in a completely random design, was established on an acidic, mineral soil rich in organic matter. The treatments were two different doses of ash (5 and 10 t haÀ1), a soluble NPK fertilizer 8:24:16 (N:P2O5:K2O, 200 g per plant) and an unfertilized control. The MWBA was incorporated into the soil after cutting and chopping the existing shrub vegetation and before planting. Application of the ash produced an increase in soil pH, and in the availability of P, Ca, Mg and K. The effects on soil pH and available Ca and Mg persisted for ﬁve growing seasons. The prolonged response in this study may be attributable to the effect of ash incorporation, which may have enhanced the solubility of wood ash compounds, despite the partly combusted material present in the ash. The ash improved the nutritional status, mainly in terms of Ca and Mg, and the vector analysis indicated that these elements were limiting forest production. The soluble NPK fertilizer did not produce any improvement in growth relative to the control. The concentrations of heavy metals in both soil and plant tissue were always low and did not increase signiﬁcantly after application of the wood-bark ash. The positive effect of ash application on height and diameter growth was signiﬁcant after 5 years, with similar results for both doses of ash. The improvement was attributed to the increases in Ca and Mg in soil.",

		"abstract": "Our knowledge about the effect of single-tree inﬂuence areas on the physicochemical properties of the underlying mineral soil in forest ecosystems is still limited. This restricts our ability to adequately estimate future changes in soil functioning due to forest management practices. We studied the stand scale spatial variation of different soil organic matter species investigated by 13C NMR spectroscopy, lignin phenol and neutral sugar analysis under an unmanaged mountainous high-elevation Norway spruce (Picea abies L.) forest in central Europe. Multivariate geostatistical approaches were applied to relate the spatial patterns of the different soil organic matter species to topographic parameters, bulk density, oxalate- and dithionite-extractable iron, pH, and the impact of tree distribution. Soil samples were taken from the mineral top soil. Generally, the stand scale distribution patterns of different soil organic matter compounds could be divided into two groups: Those compounds, which were signiﬁcantly spatially correlated with topography/altitude and those with small scale spatial pattern (range ≤ 10 m) that was closely related to tree distribution. The concentration of plant-derived soil organic matter components, such as lignin, at a given sampling point was signiﬁcantly spatially related to the distance of the nearest tree (p ≤ 0.05). In contrast, the spatial distribution of mainly microbial-derived compounds (e.g. galactose and mannose) could be attributed to the dominating impact of small-scale topography and the contribution of poorly crystalline iron oxides that were signiﬁcantly larger in the central depression of the study site compared to crest and slope positions.",

		"abstract": "The release of mineral nutrients and other species from untreated and stabilised wood ash has been investigated. Stabilisation is applied with the aim to modify the solubility of ash components and the ash particle size, i.e. to form dense ash particle agglomerates. This process induces the formation of several secondary minerals. The most important reaction is the transformation of Ca(OH)2 into CaCO3 which lowers the calcium leaching rate signi®cantly. A signi®cant fraction of the alkali metals, K and Na, is present in salts which are rapidly released. The short-term release of these salts, as simulated in laboratory experiments, was not reduced by the stabilisation methods applied. Generally, low leaching rates were observed for the important plant nutrients P and Mg as well as for Fe and other metals from both untreated and agglomerated ashes. Thermodynamic equilibrium modelling of the hardening process showed that in addition to the transformation of Ca(OH)2 to CaCO3, formation of the mineral ettringite is possible at a high pH. Experimental results have con®rmed this. As the pH in the pore solution decreases during long-term leaching ettringite will be transformed into calcium carbonate and gypsum. In accordance with the experimental results, no formation of secondary solubility controlling potassium or sodium minerals was indicated by the modelling results. # 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

There, the ash fractions were stored under varying conditions (dry, wet, open, airtight) over 16 weeks to investigate the changes in physical and chemical properties of the ashes. The results show that the main chemical reactions during storage are the formation of Ca(OH)2 from CaO and H2O and a water uptake by poorly crystallized or amorphous phases. The ash samples showed only a rather small increase in the TIC mass fraction so the carbonatation of Ca(OH)2 with CO2 to form CaCO3 played only a minor role during the time period investigated. Other reactions like the formation of ettringite or gypsum (due to the small amount of S contained in the ashes investigated) were not observed. Regarding the leaching characteristics, the Ca leaching ratio decreases over time while the K and Na leaching ratios increase. The results regarding the water demand during storage indicate that the mass fraction of Ca in the dry material in the ashes is a suitable parameter to determine the optimum water admixing rate to facilitate aging of the ashes.",

At Hasslöv, ﬁfteen years after the addition of 8.75 ton ha−1 of dolomite, the species richness of the mycorrhizal community was unchanged. However, the liming resulted in an almost total replacement of species normally found under the site conditions, with only three morphotypes from a total of 24 distinguished being common to both the control and limed plots. At Horröd, four years after the application of 3.25 ton ha−1 crushed lime, there was a signiﬁcant reduction in the number of species recorded. This was not a result of a reduction in root tips sampled, since there was no signiﬁcant treatment effect upon root tip abundance. Instead, it appeared that the less common species present in the control plots had been lost following liming. At the same site, the addition of 4.28 ton ha−1 of wood ash had little effect upon the mycorrhizal community as a whole, with only small changes recorded in the abundance of a small number of species. This study highlights the urgent need for additional data on the temporal and load response of ectomycorrhizal fungi to the addition of lime. This information is vital in view of the proposed widespread use of lime as a counter measure to soil acidiﬁcation.",

		"abstract": "Biochar’’, or charcoal intended for use as a soil amendment, has received great attention in recent years as a means of enhancing carbon sequestration and soil properties in agricultural systems. Here we address the potential for biochar use in the context of forest restoration, reviewing relevant experimental studies on biochar use in forest ecosystems, the properties of chars generated from wood waste material, and available data on tree growth responses to biochar. To our knowledge the earliest mention of char use as a soil amendment is actually speciﬁcally in the context of forest restoration (in the 1820s in Scotland). Wood waste biochars have an unusual set of properties that suggest their applicability in a forest restoration context: namely, high recalcitrance promoting long-lasting effects, retention of cations, anions, and water, in the soil, sorptive properties that can reduce bioavailability of a wide range of toxic materials, and relative ease of production from locally available feedstocks. A meta-analysis of recent studies on biochar responses of woody plants indicates a potential for large tree growth responses to biochar additions, with a mean 41 % increase in biomass. Responses are especially pronounced at early growth stages, and appear to be higher in boreal and tropical than in temperate systems, and in angiosperms than conifers; however, there is high variability, and ﬁeld studies are few. The properties of biochars also vary greatly depending on feedstock and pyrolysis conditions; while this complicates their use, it provides a means to design biochars for speciﬁc restoration situations and objectives. We conclude that there is great promise for biochar to play an important role in a wide variety of forest restoration efforts, speciﬁcally as a replacement product for other forms of organic matter and liming agents.",

Immediate effects of wood ash on lake water were investigated in three tank experiments each lasting 1.5 wk. In tank experiments, addition of wood ash increased pH, alkalinity, conductivity, and Ca and P concentrations of humic lake water, while growth of phytoplankton decreased. After wood ash application to the subcatchments, pH, alkalinity, conductivity, and concentrations of K؉, SO42Ϫ, and ClϪ slightly increased, both in inflowing waters and in the lakes, but no increased leaching of Ca, N, or P from the treated subcatchments occurred. Phytoplankton biomass increased in both experimental lakes in comparison with the reference lake. In the lake with 19% application rate to the catchment, zooplankton biomass also increased. The results indicate that, over the short term, a small-scale ash treatment to a forested drainage basin will not necessarily cause significant changes in the water quality of boreal humic lakes, but at higher application rates, changes in water chemistry and biology are more evident.",

		"abstract": "The effect of liming and ash treatment on pools, ﬂuxes and concentrations of major solutes was investigated at two forested sites (Norway spruce) in S. Sweden. One site was treated 15 yr prior to sampling (Hasslöv-Hs; dolomite: 3.45 and 8.75 t ha−1) and the other 4 yr before (Horröd-Hd; dolomite: 3.25 t ha−1; wood ash: 4.28 t ha−1). Effects of liming were most pronounced in the O horizon solutions where higher pH, elevated Ca (120–700 µM) and Mg (50–600 µM) were observed as compared to control plots. The impact on the mineral soil was more moderate. Soil solution concentrations were combined with modelled hydrological ﬂow to calculate mass ﬂows, which largely followed the trends of the solution composition. Liming also resulted in large increases of both exchangeable Ca and Mg as well as effective cation exchange capacity (CECE; 2–5 times the controls). The base saturation (BS%) was raised to 60–100% in the O horizon while in the mineral soil elevated values were only seen at the Hs site (20–60%; down to 10–15 cm depth for 8.75 t ha−1). Ash treatment did not affect either the soil solution nor the exchangeable pool to the same extent as lime. In general, the impact at the Hd site was less pronounced especially in the mineral soil, which might be due to shorter treatment time (4 vs. 15 yr) and also different thickness of the O horizon. Budget calculations for Ca and Mg originating from the lime showed that a major part of the Ca (40–100%) was retained in the top 30 cm of the soil, of which 30–95% was present in the O horizon. The mobility of Mg was greater and it was estimated that a signiﬁcant part had been leached from the proﬁle (30 and 50 cm depth) after 15 yr. Increased mass ﬂows of NO−3 due to nitriﬁcation resulting from liming at the Hs site were calculated in the range 120–350 mmol m−2 yr−1 (or 1.2–3.5 kmol ha−1 yr−1). There was signiﬁcant leaching of Al (25–60 mmol m−2 yr−1), of which about 70% was inorganic, in the lower B horizon at both sites with no inﬂuence of liming.",

We conducted an experiment between 2002 and 2005, investigating the effects of biofuel ash and nitrogen fertilisation applied to Scots Pine stands on nutrient poor Arenosols. We studied the effects of three fertilization treatments (biofuel ash, nitrogen and ash applied together with nitrogen) on dry mass and concentrations of the main nutrients (N, P, K, Ca and Mg) and other elements (Cu, Zn, Cd, Cr, Ni, and Pb) in different compartments and layers of the canopy. The biofuel ash, nitrogen fertilizers and ash applied together with nitrogen led to heavier needles in the upper and middle layers of the canopy with less effect toward the canopy base. The complex ash plus nitrogen treatment gave the strongest significant response. All treatments resulted in an increase in dry mass, but not in the length of the current year needles. The additional input of nitrogen induced higher increase in dry mass compared to the changes of N concentration in the youngest needles. On the basis of the present study results, it can be concluded that the youngest needles produced new mass per amount of nitrogen more effectively compared to older needles.",

		"abstract": "An extended overview of the phase–mineral and chemical composition and classiﬁcation of biomass ash (BA) was conducted. Some general considerations related to the composition of BA and particularly problems associated with this issue were discussed initially. Then, reference peer-reviewed data including phase–mineral composition and properties of BAs plus own investigations were used to describe and organise the BA system. It was found that BA is a complex inorganic–organic mixture with polycomponent, heterogeneous and variable composition. The phase–mineral composition of BA includes: (1) mostly inorganic matter composed of non-crystalline (amorphous) and crystalline to semi-crystalline (mineral) constituents; (2) subordinately organic matter consisting of char and organic minerals; and (3) some ﬂuid matter comprising moisture and gas and gas–liquid inclusions associated with both inorganic and organic matter. Approximately 229 forming, major, minor or accessory phases or minerals were identiﬁed in BA. These species have primary, secondary or tertiary origin in the combustion residue and they are generated from natural (authigenic and detrital) and technogenic phases or minerals originally present in biomass. Common topics related to BA such as: terminology clariﬁcation; chemical composition; contents and concentration trends; correlations and associations; formation and behaviour; fusion temperatures; and leaching; were discussed and compared to coal ash. A general characterization of the phase–mineral composition and description of the occurrence and origin for common constituents in BA, namely: (1) silicates; (2) oxides and hydroxides; (3) sulphates (plus sulphides, sulphosalts, sulphites and thiosulphates); (4) phosphates; (5) carbonates (plus bicarbonates); (6) chlorides (plus chlorites and chlorates); (7) nitrates; (8) glass; (9) other inorganic phases; (10) organic phases; and (11) organic minerals; were also conducted and compared to coal ash. Finally, certain major associations related to the occurrence, content and origin of elements and phases were identiﬁed in the BA system and they include: (1) Si–Al–Fe–Na–Ti (mostly glass, silicates and oxyhydroxides); (2) Ca–Mg–Mn (commonly carbonates, oxyhydroxides, glass, silicates and some phosphates and sulphates); and (3) K–P–S–Cl (normally phosphates, sulphates, chlorides, glass and some silicates and carbonates). It was found that these systematic associations in BA have a key importance in both fundamental and applied aspects, namely their potential application for classiﬁcation and indicator purposes connected with innovative and sustainable processing of BA. The potential utilization, technological and environmental advantages and challenges related to BA using the above classiﬁcation approach are described in Part 2 of the present work.",

		"abstract": "Ash from combustion of biofuels, for example wood chips, is often deposited as waste, but due to its high content of essential plant nutrients and alkalinity, it has been proposed to recycle ash as a fertilizer and liming agent in biofuel production forest. However, current legislation sets rather strict limitations for wood-ash application in biofuel production systems. The soil microfood web, that is microorganisms and their microfaunal grazers, protozoa and nematodes, is pivotal for essential ecosystem processes such as decomposition and plant nutrient release. Therefore, a thorough assessment of the impacts on microfood web structure and functioning must precede actions towards raising the currently allowed application rates. In a Danish Norway spruce plantation, we evaluate the impact of wood ash applied at dosages from 0 to the extreme case of 90 t ash haÀ1 on the microfood web, the bacterial community structure, soil content of inorganic nitrogen, organic matter, dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen. Using structural equation modelling (SEM), we disentangled the direct effect of the disturbance imposed by ash per se, the associated pH increase and changes in prey abundance on individual organism groups in the microfood web. The SEM showed that the pH rise was the main driver of increasing abundances of culturable heterotrophic bacteria with increasing ash doses, and via trophical transfer, this also manifested as higher abundances of bacterial grazers. Fungal-feeding nematodes were unaffected by ash, whereas carnivorous/omnivorous nematodes decreased due to the direct effect of ash. Increasing ash doses enhanced the difference between bacterial communities of control plots and ash-amended plots. The ashinduced stimulation of culturable heterotrophic bacteria and bacterial grazers increased inorganic nitrogen availability at ash doses of 9 t haÀ1 and above. Hence, raised limits for ash application may potentially beneﬁt tree growth via enhanced N mineralization activity of the soil food web.",

The study was based on ﬁeld experiments carried out on two mires in Finland in 1997e1998. Two different types of wood ash were applied at dosages of 3500, 3700, 10 500 and 11 100 kg haÀ1.

Wood ash application resulted in increased leachate pH, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and electrical conductivity (EC). Increasing application of wood ash increased cumulative release of inorganic carbon (IC), chloride (Cl), nitrate (NO3), sulfate (SO4), potassium (K), sodium (Na), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), manganese (Mn), phosphorus (P), and copper (Cu). Release of NO3, P, iron (Fe), aluminum (Al), Cu, and lead (Pb) continued. Large amounts of DOC, K, Ca, and SO4 were mobilized. Inorganic C, Fe, and Mg were released in moderate quantities. Manganese, Na, Al, Cl, and NO3 were released in limited amounts. Amounts of leached P, Pb, and Cu were lower. The mixed order equation adequately described the release of elements in the soilash mixture. Accumulation of elevated amounts of trace elements does not appear to be a problem when higher wood ash rates are avoided. Wood ash should be applied in split application to avoid short-term concentrated alkaline and salty conditions that could interfere with plant growth.",

		"abstract": "Food-web structure mediates dramatic effects of biodiversity loss including secondary and ‘cascading’ extinctions. We studied these effects by simulating primary species loss in 16 food webs from terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and measuring robustness in terms of the secondary extinctions that followed. As observed in other networks, food webs are more robust to random removal of species than to selective removal of species with the most trophic links to other species. More surprisingly, robustness increases with food-web connectance but appears independent of species richness and omnivory. In particular, food webs experience ‘rivet-like’ thresholds past which they display extreme sensitivity to removal of highly connected species. Higher connectance delays the onset of this threshold. Removing species with few trophic connections generally has little effect though there are several striking exceptions. These ﬁndings emphasize how the number of species removed affects ecosystems differently depending on the trophic functions of species removed.",

Marine microbiotas include core taxa that are usually key for ecosystem function. Despite their importance, core marine microbes are relatively unknown, which reflects the lack of consensus on how to identify them. So far, most core microbiotas have been defined based on species occurrence and abundance. Yet, species interactions are also important to identify core microbes, as communities include interacting species. Here, we investigate interconnected bacteria and small protists of the core pelagic microbiota populating a long-term marine-coastal observatory in the Mediterranean Sea over a decade.\n          \n          \n            Results\n            Core microbes were defined as those present in >30% of the monthly samples over 10 years, with the strongest associations. The core microbiota included 259 Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) including 182 bacteria, 77 protists, and 1,411 strong and mostly positive (∼95%) associations. Core bacteria tended to be associated with other bacteria, while core protists tended to be associated with bacteria. The richness and abundance of core OTUs varied annually, decreasing in stratified warmers waters and increasing in colder mixed waters. Most core OTUs had a preference for one season, mostly winter, which featured subnetworks with the highest connectivity. Groups of highly associated taxa tended to include protists and bacteria with predominance in the same season, particularly winter. A group of 13 highly-connected hub-OTUs, with potentially important ecological roles dominated in winter and spring. Similarly, 18 connector OTUs with a low degree but high centrality were mostly associated with summer or autumn and may represent transitions between seasonal communities.\n          \n          \n            Conclusions\n            We found a relatively small and dynamic interconnected core microbiota in a model temperate marine-coastal site, with potential interactions being more deterministic in winter than in other seasons. These core microbes would be essential for the functioning of this ecosystem over the year. Other non-core taxa may also carry out important functions but would be redundant and non-essential. Our work contributes toth e understanding of the dynamics and potential interactions of core microbes possibly sustaining ocean ecosystem function.",

		"abstract": "Human microbiome studies are increasingly incorporating macroecological approaches, such as community assembly, network analysis and functional redundancy to more fully characterize the microbiome. Such analyses have not been applied to ancient human microbiomes, preventing insights into human microbiome evolution. We address this issue by analysing published ancient microbiome datasets: coprolites from Rio Zape (\n              n\n              = 7; 700 CE Mexico) and historic dental calculus (\n              n\n              = 44; 1770–1855 CE, UK), as well as two novel dental calculus datasets: Maya (\n              n\n              = 7; 170 BCE-885 CE, Belize) and Nuragic Sardinians (\n              n\n              = 11; 1400–850 BCE, Italy). Periodontitis-associated bacteria (\n              Treponema denticola\n              ,\n              Fusobacterium nucleatum\n              and\n              Eubacterium saphenum\n              ) were identified as keystone taxa in the dental calculus datasets. Coprolite keystone taxa included known short-chain fatty acid producers (\n              Eubacterium biforme, Phascolarctobacterium succinatutens\n              ) and potentially disease-associated bacteria (\n              Escherichia\n              ,\n              Brachyspira)\n              . Overlap in ecological profiles between ancient and modern microbiomes was indicated by similarity in functional response diversity profiles between contemporary hunter–gatherers and ancient coprolites, as well as parallels between ancient Maya, historic UK, and modern Spanish dental calculus; however, the ancient Nuragic dental calculus shows a distinct ecological structure. We detected key ecological signatures from ancient microbiome data, paving the way to expand understanding of human microbiome evolution.\n            \n            This article is part of the theme issue ‘Insights into health and disease from ancient biomolecules’.",

		"abstract": "The use of wood ash in forestry has been questioned because the cadmium (Cd) concentration of ash, which varies between 1 and 20 mg kg−1 ash, exceeds the level allowed for fertilizers (3 mg kg−1) used in agriculture. To investigate the combined and separated effects of Cd and ash on the forest humus microflora, pumice or wood ash, spiked with a water-soluble (CdCl2) or -insoluble (CdO) form of Cd at three levels (0, 400 and 1000 mg kg−1), were applied at a fertilization level of 5000 kg ha−1 in a laboratory microcosm study. The trial consisted of 60 microcosms (five replications per treatment), which were incubated in darkness at +20°C and a constant relative air humidity of 60%. After two months the humus in the microcosms was sampled. Analyses of CO2 evolution to measure the overall microbial activity and of phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) pattern to measure microbial community structure were performed. The substrate-use patterns of Biolog EcoPlates were analyzed as a measure of bacterial functionality. Finally the bacterial 3H-thymidine incorporation in the presence of different concentrations of Cd and the number of colony forming units (cfu) of bacteria on nutrient agar in the presence of 0, 5 and 20 mg Cd l−1 agar were applied to measure Cd tolerance. The use of pumice (pH of humus under the pumice 4.0) did not induce any changes in the above variables compared to two untreated microcosms (humus pH 3.9). Pumice was therefore used to distribute the Cd evenly over the humus surface in order to estimate the possible effect of Cd without ash (pH of humus under the ash 7.0). The application of ash increased the microbial activity, changed the PLFA and substrate-use patterns and increased cfu compared to the humus under pumice. The form and level of Cd in the ash had no further effect on this result. In the humus under pumice the level, but not the form of Cd decreased the microbial activity and changed the PLFA pattern compared to the unspiked pumice. None of the treatments induced bacterial tolerance to Cd. Ash thus protected the humus microflora from the harmful effects of Cd.",

We conclude that there were no negative effects of applying either wood ash and that application of ash at 10 000 kg·ha−1, particularly with the low-carbon ash, produced the greatest changes.

		"abstract": "Here we have investigated the effects of the addition of two different wood ash sizes at two different doses (5 and 20t/ha) on the physico-chemical, microbiological and biochemical properties in the surface soil (0–30cm) of an Italian agricultural system. Over 24 months, the pH, electrical conductivity, soil microbial biomass-C and -N, and total hydrolytic activity were periodically tested, together with alkaline phosphatase, arylsulphatase and o-diphenoloxidase activities. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to consider the effects of sampling time and wood ash addition on the parameters tested and to reveal possible interactions between the two variables. For electrical conductivity, pH, soil microbial biomass-C and total hydrolytic activity the ANOVA showed a significant ‘wood ash type× sampling time’ interaction, while no interaction was found for the other enzymatic activities. Significant increases in pH and in electrical conductivity were seen over the first months in all of the treated samples, which were more pronounced at the higher dose. Decreases in microbial biomass-C and changes in the microbial C/N ratios were seen for all of the treatments, which were more pronounced at the higher dose. Increases in soil microbial activity were seen over the first 8 months. The alkaline phosphatase and arylsulphatase activities were significantly inhibited for the first 4 months of soil treatment. The significant increases seen in o-diphenoloxidase activity over the first 8 months under all of the treatments appear to be related to the increases in electrical conductivity. After 12 months, the levels of all of the parameters tested in the treated soils returned to the levels of the untreated soils indicating that the disposal of up to 20t/ha of wood ash per year in Italian agricultural soil does not result in long-term changes in any of these parameters.",

		"abstract": "In boreal forests of eastern Canada, wildfire has gradually been replaced by clearcut harvesting as the most extensive form of disturbance. Such a shift in disturbance may influence the chemical properties of the forest floor and its capacity to cycle and supply nutrients, with possible implications for forest productivity. We compared the effects of stem-only harvesting (SOH), whole-tree harvesting (WTH) and wildfire on the chemical composition of forest floor organic matter and nutrient availability for plants, 15–20 years after disturbance in boreal coniferous stands in Quebec (Canada). The forest floor on plots of wildfire origin was significantly enriched in aromatic forms of C with low solubility, whereas the forest floor from SOH and WTH plots was enriched with more soluble and labile C compounds. The forest floor of wildfire plots was also characterized by higher N concentration, but its high C:N and high concentration of 15N suggest that its N content could be recalcitrant and have a slow turnover rate. Total and exchangeable K were associated with easily degradable organic structures, whereas total and exchangeable Ca and Mg were positively correlated with the more recalcitrant forms of C. We suggest that the bulk of Ca and Mg cycling in the soil–plant system is inherited from the influx of exchangeable cations in the forest floor following disturbance. The buildup of Ca and Mg exchangeable reserves should be greater with wildfire than with harvesting, due to the sudden pulse of cation-rich ash and to the deposition of charred materials with high exchange capacity. This raises uncertainties about the long-term availability of Ca and Mg for plant uptake on harvested sites. In contrast, K availability should not be compromised by either harvesting or wildfire since it could be recycled rapidly through vegetation, litter and labile organic compounds.",

		"abstract": "Tetracycline antibiotics (TA) used in veterinary medicine reach terrestrial ecosystems mostly via the repeated applications of animal manures and slurries on agricultural soils, where they may cause toxic effects on bacterial communities. In the current work, we studied the efficacy of adding doses of 0, 6, 24 and 48 g kg−1 of biomass ash (BA) to four different soils to reduce potential negative effects of tetracycline antibiotics. Specifically, soil samples were polluted with different concentrations of tetracycline, oxytetracycline or chlortetracycline, and the bacterial community growth was estimated using the 3H leucine incorporation technique. Soil amendment with BA increased soil pH (1.3–4.8 units), total carbon (0.7–5.8 g kg−1) and Fe and Al oxides concentrations (0.25–3.98 g kg−1), as well as bacterial activity (1–9 times compared to the control). In addition, BA amendment at high doses (24 or 48 g kg−1) resulted in a similar toxicity decrease for the three antibiotics, but with variations among soils. The reductions in antibiotics toxicity were very variable, ranging between 5% and 100% (total recovery). In view of that, the spreading of BA could be interesting as management practice to reduce risks of soil pollution and subsequent toxicity on bacterial communities due to tetracycline antibiotics.",

However, wood ash amendment affects soil physicochemical parameters that control composition and functional expression of the soil microbial community. Here, we applied total RNA sequencing to simultaneously assess the impact of wood ash amendment on the active soil microbial communities and the expression of functional genes from all microbial taxa. Wood ash significantly affected the taxonomic (rRNA) as well as functional (mRNA) profiles of both agricultural and forest soil. Increase in pH, electrical conductivity, dissolved organic carbon and phosphate were the most important physicochemical drivers for the observed changes. Wood ash amendment increased the relative abundance of the copiotrophic groups Chitinonophagaceae (Bacteroidetes) and Rhizobiales (Alphaproteobacteria) and resulted in higher expression of genes involved in metabolism and cell growth. Finally, total RNA sequencing allowed us to show that some groups of bacterial feeding protozoa increased concomitantly to the enhanced bacterial growth, which shows their pivotal role in the regulation of bacterial abundance in soil.",

		"abstract": "Digestate from biogas production contains a significant amount in organic matter and N, whereas fly ash from biomass combustion is rich in P and other nutrients. The use of both, as suitable fertilizers, has been shown to improve crop yields and soil properties. A Chernozem soil was used in a pot experiment in which wheat was grown to evaluate the impact of digestate (organic amendment) and fly ash (inorganic amendment) application on soil microbial activity, biomass and community structure. Soil samples were collected after two time-term treatments (30 and 60 days). Digestate application significantly improved soil chemical variables, microbial activity, the substrate average well colour development (SAWCD) and physiological diversity. Bacterial, actinobacterial, and fungal communities were positively affected by digestate addition, as well as microbial biomass. These effects were evident after a short period (30 days), but were more significant after long-term treatment (60 days). However, fly ash did not provoke significant changes in soil microbial activities, qPCR or PLFA at any time of treatment. Nevertheless, with this amendment, some chemical variables were positively affected after 60 days of treatment and the SAWCD revealed different patterns in the use of C sources compared with un-amended and digestate-amended soil at both treatment times. These results suggest that the chemical properties present in digestate may determine its use as a suitable organic amendment because it improves soil health and quality, whereas fly ash did not have a relevant impact on soil microbial activities, qPCR, or PLFA.",

Wood ash application to soil leads to strong vertical gradients in physicochemical parameters. Consequently, we designed an experimental system where small-scale vertical changes in soil properties and prokaryotic community structure could be followed after wood ash application. A mixed fly and bottom ash was applied in dosages of 3 and 9 t ha−1 to the surface of soil mesocosms, simulating a typical coniferous podzol. Soil pH, exchangeable cations and 16S prokaryotic community was subsequently assessed at small depth intervals to 5 cm depth at regular intervals for one year. Wood ash significantly changed the prokaryotic community in the top of the soil column. Also, the largest increases in pH and concentrations of exchangeable cations was found here. The relative abundance of prokaryotic groups directionally changed, suggesting that wood ash favors copiotrophic prokaryotes at the expense of oligotrophic and acidophilic taxa. The effect of wood ash were negligible both in terms of pH- and biological changes in lower soil layers. Consequently, by micro-vertical profiling we showed that wood ash causes a steep gradient of abiotic factors driving biotic changes but only in the top-most soil layers.",

		"abstract": "Wood ash is produced by burning wood residues for energy and is often landfilled but can be more sustainably used as a forest soil amendment. We investigated how different fly and bottom wood ashes applied at a moderate 10 Mg∙ha−1 (dry) affected earthworms, a key group of forest soil biota. We conducted a field experiment with different wood ashes and application timings to determine the effects on population densities of different earthworm functional groups three weeks and one year post-amendment. We also used three laboratory microcosm experiments focused on the geographically widespread and ecologically influential anecic earthworm Lumbricus terrestris to test how wood ashes affect acute survivorship as well as habitat avoidance and surface feeding behaviors. In the field, wood ash amendment generally decreased or had no impact on earthworm densities in the first three weeks following amendment (with density decreases up to − 52 m−2), but had neutral or minor positive impacts one year later (up to + 21 m−2). In the laboratory, wood ashes generally had no effects on short-term earthworm survivorship or growth, but earthworms did respond behaviorally to certain wood ashes by habitat avoidance and reduced surface activity, with decreases in the overall frequency of aboveground events (−63%), the individual duration of each event (−63%), and the percentage of events that involved contact with litter (−53%). Across all experiments, fly ash tended to have a stronger effect than bottom ash. Overall, our study suggests that while some wood ashes may have limited short-term impacts on earthworm abundances, they may cause more subtle but ecologically important behavioral changes. Additionally, these earthworm-wood ash interactions are likely influenced by highly scenario-specific circumstances, including wood ash type, application site, and timing of application.",

		"abstract": "The identification of causal links between microbial community structure and ecosystem functions are required for a mechanistic understanding of ecosystem responses to environmental change. One of the most influential factors affecting plants and microbial communities in soil in managed ecosystems is the current land-use. In forestry, wood ash has been proposed as a liming agent and a fertilizer, but has been questioned due to the risk associated with its Cd content. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of wood ash on the structure and function of decomposer microbial communities in forest soils and to assign them to causal mechanisms. To do this, we assessed the responses to wood ash application of (i) the microbial community size and structure, (ii) microbial community trait-distributions, including bacterial pH relationships and Cd-tolerance, to assign the microbial responses to pH and Cd, and (iii) consequences for proxies of the function soil organic matter (SOM) turnover including respiration and microbial growth rates. Two sets of field-experiments in temperate conifer forest plantations were combined with laboratory microcosm experiments where wood ash additions were compared to additions of lime and Cd. Wood ash induced structural changes in the microbial community in both field experiments, and striking similarities were observed between the application of ash and that of lime in the microcosm experiments. Wood ash increased pH, and led to a shift toward faster SOM decomposition and a reduced importance of fungi. This coincided with shifts in bacterial community trait distributions for pH, with pH optima closely tracking the new soil pH. A Cd solution could induce Cd-tolerance in the microcosm experiments, but the ash did not affect the microbial tolerance to Cd in field or microcosm experiments. We demonstrate that the microbial community responded strongly to the application of wood ash to forest soils with consequences for its functional capabilities in terms of respiration and growth rates. The bacterial community's trait distributions revealed that the increased pH directly caused the microbial responses, while the wood ash associated Cd has no detectable effects on the microbial community. The study demonstrates the power of community trait distributions to (i) causally link microbial structural responses to environmental change and (ii) potential to predict the ecosystem functional consequences.",

		"abstract": "Large-scale liming and wood ash addition are common practices to mitigate soil and water acidification in temperate and boreal forests. In addition, wood ash recycles nutrients removed at harvest to the forest ecosystem. Both liming and wood ash applications typically increase soil pH by 1–2 units. Therefore, they affect a range of soil processes and organisms including ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi which are vital for the nutrition of many tree species. Here we review field studies reporting the effects of lime and wood ash amendments on EM fungi. We systematically compiled studies where known amounts of ash or lime were distributed to plots paired with comparable control plots, and where mycorrhizal variables were recorded. For a subset of studies meeting explicit criteria, we performed meta-analyses using overall mycorrhizal abundance, species richness or the abundance of specific fungal taxa as response variables. Guided by availability of data, the focus is on Nordic coniferous forests. Although the reviewed field studies varied widely in dosage and experimental setup they clearly demonstrated that liming and wood ash amendments influence EM fungal species composition. Across studies, species belonging to the lineages Cortinarius and Russula-lactarius (Basidiomycota), particularly Russula ochroleuca, decreased in relative abundance, while species within the Tuber-helvella (Ascomycota) increased. Particular species within the Amphinema-tylospora lineage responded in opposite directions; Tylospora fibrillosa decreased in relation to the control, while Amphinema byssoides increased. The significant changes in species or clade abundances were in the range of 5–20% compared to non-treated plots. In contrast, neither the belowground mycorrhizal biomass nor species richness responded to liming or wood ash applications. We conclude that liming and wood ash amendments cause consistent EM fungal species dominance shifts, but that a high EM fungal biomass and species and phylogenetic richness is maintained on the tree roots. Given the large dispersal potential of many EM fungi, we therefore suggest that these treatments at normal recommended dosages do not pose any immediate threats to EM fungal biodiversity, at least not when applied at relatively small spatial scales. Whether the observed dominance shifts among EM fungal clades have consequences for the functioning of the EM fungal guild, e.g. in relation to nutrient cycling or tree nutrition, is an important question that should be further investigated.",

		"abstract": "Experiments with potted plants and removed understories have indicated that understory vegetation often affects the chemical and microbial properties of soil. In this study, we examined the mechanism and extent of the influence of understory vegetation on the chemical and microbial properties of soil in plantation forests. The relationships between the vegetational structure (diversity for different functional layers, aboveground biomass of understory vegetation, and species number) and soil properties (pH, microbial community structure, and levels of soil organic carbon, total nitrogen, and inorganic nitrogen) were analyzed across six reforestation types (three pure needleleaf forests, a needle-broadleaf mixed forest, a broadleaf forest, and a shrubland). Twenty-seven years after reforestation, soil pH significantly decreased by an average of 0.95 across reforestation types. Soil pH was positively correlated with the aboveground biomass of the understory. The levels of total, bacterial, and fungal phospholipid fatty acids, and the fungal:bacterial ratios were similar in the shrubland and the broadleaf forest. Both the aboveground biomass of the understory and the diversity of the tree layer positively influenced the fungal:bacterial ratio. Improving the aboveground biomass of the understory could alleviate soil acidification. An increase in the aboveground biomass of the understory, rather than in understory diversity, enhanced the functional traits of the soil microbial communities. The replacement of pure plantations with mixed-species stands, as well as the enhancement of understory recruitment, can improve the ecological functions of a plantation, as measured by the alleviation of soil acidification and increased fungal dominance.",

		"abstract": "It is of great importance to understand how terrestrial ecosystems will respond to global changes. However, most experimental approaches have focused on single factors. In natural systems, moisture and temperature often change simultaneously, and they can interact and shape microbial responses. Even though soil moisture and temperature are very important factors controlling microbial activity, there is disagreement on the dependence of microbial rates on temperature and moisture as well as their sensitivity when both variables change simultaneously. Here we created a moisture gradient and determined high resolution intrinsic temperature dependences for bacterial and fungal growth rates as well as respiration rates. We found that microbial rates decreased with lower moisture and increased with higher temperatures until optimum values. Additionally, we found independence between temperature and moisture as rate modifiers. We also found that temperature sensitivities (Q10) for microbial growth and respiration were not affected by changes in moisture. This provided an experimental framework to validate assumptions of temperature and moisture rate modifiers used in ecosystem and global cycling models (GCMs).",

		"abstract": "The use of wood ash in forestry has been questioned because of the potential risk associated with its cadmium (Cd) content (1–30 mg kg−1). In agriculture, wood ash is only allowed for use as a fertilizer when its Cd content is below 3 mg kg−1. This restriction has not been applied to forest soils and there is a lack of knowledge about the potentially harmful effects of the Cd in wood ash on forest ecosystems. This paper summarizes our recent studies on the microbial communities of boreal coniferous forest humus exposed to Cd-containing wood ash treatment. The main objectives of our studies were to test if the Cd in wood ash has the potential to affect the humus layer microflora of coniferous upland forests and if it has the potential to enter the human food chain. These objectives were tested both in laboratory and field experiments with ash and ash spiked with Cd (in laboratory 400 or 1,000 mg Cd kg−1 as CdO or CdCl2; in field 400 mg Cd kg−1 as CdO). In one study the dissolution of ash was accelerated by irrigating it with simulated acid rain (SAR). Wood ash increased humus layer pH and microbial activities (respiration or thymidine incorporation rates) and changed its microfloral community structure (Biolog, PLFA, 16S or 18S rDNA PCR-DGGE) in both laboratory and field experiments. Spiking ash with Cd induced no further changes in the above-mentioned variables compared to ash alone. The Cd added with wood ash did not become bioavailable as detected with a bacterial biosensor Bacillus subtilis BR151(pTOO24). The form and level of Cd added in the ash had no further effect on the microbiological variables studied. Irrigation of ash with SAR did not increase the amount of bioavailable Cd, although the dissolution rate of the ash was increased. The concentration of Cd in soil water and in the berries of Vaccinium uliginosum and V. vitis-idaea, and the amount of humus bioavailable Cd did not increase with applied ash or ash spiked with Cd although the ash spiked with Cd increased the amount of humus total and extractable Cd in the 4-year field study. Only the ash spiked with Cd and not the unspiked “normal” wood ash resulted in significantly higher Cd concentrations in the mushroom Lactarius rufus and a slight increase in the berries of Empetrum nigrum (first year only). In conclusion, the Cd in wood ash did not become bioavailable and harmful to forest soil microbes, or leach into the humus layer even when treated with simulated acid rain. It is thus safe to use wood ash as a fertilizer in forests. However, since wood ash adds Cd to the environment, it is recommended that the same sites should not be fertilized with wood ash more than once. The effects of wood ash (3 t ha−1) on forest soil humus layer microbes are long-term, lasting at least 20 years, and probably longer if higher application dose and/or hardened ash is used.",

		"abstract": "Soils are a fundamental component of terrestrial ecosystems, and play key roles in biogeochemical cycles and the ecology of microbial, plant and animal communities. Global increases in the intensity and frequency of ecological disturbances are driving major changes in the structure and function of forest ecosystems, yet little is known about the long-term impacts of disturbance on soils. Here we show that natural disturbance (fire) and human disturbances (clearcut logging and post-fire salvage logging) can significantly alter the composition of forest soils for far longer than previously recognized. Using extensive sampling across a multi-century chronosequence in some of the tallest and most carbon-dense forests worldwide (southern Australian, mountain ash (Eucalyptus regnans) forests), we provide compelling evidence that disturbance impacts on soils are evident up to least eight decades after disturbance, and potentially much longer. Relative to long-undisturbed forest (167 years old), sites subject to multiple fires, clearcut logging or salvage logging were characterized by soils with significantly lower values of a range of ecologically important measures at multiple depths, including available phosphorus and nitrate. Disturbance impacts on soils were most pronounced on sites subject to compounding perturbations, such as multiple fires and clearcut logging. Long-lasting impacts of disturbance on soil can have major ecological and functional implications.",

		"abstract": "N-Acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase (NAGase, EC 3.2.1.30) is one of three enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of chitin. This hydrolysis is important in carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling in soils because it participates in the processes whereby chitin is converted to amino sugars, which are major sources of mineralizable N in soils. This study investigated the relationship between N mineralization indexes and activity of β-glucosaminidase in soils from six agroecological zones of the North Central region of the United States. Nitrogen mineralization was studied by using short-term laboratory incubations under aerobic and anaerobic conditions and by hydrolysis of soil organic N by steam distillation with chemical reagents. Enzyme activity was assayed at its optimal pH value. The amounts of N mineralized by all the biological and chemical methods studied were significantly correlated with β-glucosaminidase activity, with r values of 0.73*** and 0.76*** for the amounts of released by steam distillation with PO4-B4O7 for 4 or 8 min, respectively; of 0.69*** and 0.74*** for the amounts of released with Na2B4O7 for 4 or 8 min, respectively; of 0.47*** for the amounts of inorganic N produced under aerobic incubation; of 0.80*** for amounts of inorganic N produced by incubation under anaerobic conditions of field-moist soils; and of 0.86*** for anaerobic incubation of air-dried soils. There was a significant correlation between β-glucosaminidase activity and organic C (r = 0.56***), total N (r = 0.60***), and fixed of the soils (r = 0.79***). The amounts of inorganic N released by the methods, with the exception of those under aerobic incubation, were significantly (P < 0.001) correlated with organic C and total N contents of the soils, with r values ranging from 0.65*** to 0.78*** and from 0.62*** to 0.80*** for organic C and total N, respectively.",

We investigated the influence of climatic and soil traits on phosphatase activity in terrestrial systems using metadata analysis from published studies. This is the first analysis of global measurements of phosphatase in natural soils. Our results suggest that organic P (Porg), rather than available P, is the most important P fraction in predicting phosphatase activity. Structural equation modeling using soil total nitrogen (TN), mean annual precipitation, mean annual temperature, thermal amplitude and total soil carbon as most available predictor variables explained up to 50% of the spatial variance in phosphatase activity. In this analysis, Porg could not be tested and among the rest of available variables, TN was the most important factor explaining the observed spatial gradients in phosphatase activity. On the other hand, phosphatase activity was also found to be associated with climatic conditions and soil type across different biomes worldwide. The close association among different predictors like Porg, TN and precipitation suggest that P recycling is driven by a broad scale pattern of ecosystem productivity capacity.",

The taxonomic composition of microbial communities varies substantially between environments, but the ecological causes of this variation remain largely unknown. We analyzed taxonomic and functional community profiles to determine the factors that shape marine bacterial and archaeal communities across the global ocean. By classifying >30,000 marine microorganisms into metabolic functional groups, we were able to disentangle functional from taxonomic community variation. We find that environmental conditions strongly influence the distribution of functional groups in marine microbial communities by shaping metabolic niches, but only weakly influence taxonomic composition within individual functional groups. Hence, functional structure and composition within functional groups constitute complementary and roughly independent \"axes of variation\" shaped by markedly different processes.",

		"abstract": "Fungi typically live in highly diverse communities composed of multiple ecological guilds. Although high-throughput sequencing has greatly increased the ability to quantify the diversity of fungi in environmental samples, researchers currently lack a simple and consistent way to sort large sequence pools into ecologically meaningful categories. We address this issue by introducing FUNGuild, a tool that can be used to taxonomically parse fungal OTUs by ecological guild independent of sequencing platform or analysis pipeline. Using a database and an accompanying bioinformatics script, we demonstrate the application of FUNGuild to three high-throughput sequencing datasets from different habitats: forest soils, grassland soils, and decomposing wood. We found that guilds characteristic of each habitat (i.e., saprotrophic and ectomycorrhizal fungi in forest soils, saprotrophic and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in grassland soils, saprotrophic, wood decomposer, and plant pathogenic fungi in decomposing wood) were each well represented. The example datasets demonstrate that while we could quickly and efficiently assign a large portion of the data to guilds, another large portion could not be assigned, reflecting the need to expand and improve the database as well as to gain a better understanding of natural history for many described and undescribed fungal species. As a community resource, FUNGuild is dependent on third-party annotation, so we invite researchers to populate it with new categories and records as well as refine those already in existence.",

		"abstract": "Soil invertebrates are known to be much involved in soil behaviour and therefore in the provision of ecosystem services. Functional trait-based approaches are methodologies which can be used to understand soil invertebrates’ responses to their environment. They (i) improve the predictions and (ii) are less dependent on space and time. The way traits have been used recently has led to misunderstandings in the integration and interpretation of data. Trait semantics are especially concerned. The aim of this paper is to propose a thesaurus for soil invertebrate trait-based approaches. T-SITA, an Internet platform, is the first initiative to deal with the semantics of traits and ecological preferences for soil invertebrates. It reflects the agreement of a scientific expert community to fix semantic properties (e.g. definition) of approximately 100 traits and ecological preferences. In addition, T-SITA has been successfully linked with a fully operational database of soil invertebrate traits. Such a link enhances data integration and improves the scientific integrity of data.",

		"abstract": "Microbes, i.e. viruses, prokaryotes, protists and fungi are main players in biogeochemical cycles in aquatic and soil systems. As predators, pathogens, commensals and symbionts they are associated with multicellular life forms. Microbes show a dazzling array of biodiversity and it has been argued that due to their small size and huge numbers, microbes are distributed worldwide (‘everything is everywhere’). However, we summarize evidence that even free-living microbes have biogeographies and thus might be subject to at least local extinctions. Furthermore, some microbes do seem to be restricted to very particular environments and are endangered in as much as these environments are threatened. Finally, microbes intimately associated with other organisms share (partially) the biogeographies of their hosts. As far as they are species-specific, they could potentially become extinct along with their hosts. Overall, extinction rates typically reported are underestimates, since they do not take into account associated microorganisms which likely become extinct with the host organism, plant or animal. As multicellular species can have specific viral, prokaryotic, protistan and fungal species associated with them, extinction rates could be several times higher than assumed previously.",

		"abstract": "Distributions of species, animals or plants, terrestrial or aquatic, are inﬂuenced by numerous factors such as physical and biogeographical gradients. Dominant wind and current directions cause the appearance of gradients in physical conditions whereas biogeographical gradients can be the result of historical events (e.g. glaciations). No spatial modelling technique has been developed to this day that considers the direction of an asymmetric process controlling species distributions along a gradient or network. This paper presents a new method that can model species spatial distributions generated by a hypothesized asymmetric, directional physical process. This method is an eigenfunction-based spatial ﬁltering technique that offers as much ﬂexibility as the Moran’s eigenvector maps (MEM) framework; it is called asymmetric eigenvector maps (AEM) modelling. Information needed to construct eigenfunctions through the AEM framework are the spatial coordinates of the sampling or experimental sites, a connexion diagram linking the sites to one another, prior information about the direction of the hypothesized asymmetric process inﬂuencing the response variable(s), and optionally, weights attached to the edges (links). To illustrate how this new method works, AEM is compared to MEM analysis through simulations and in the analysis of an ecological example where a known asymmetric forcing is present. The ecological example reanalyses the dietary habits of brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) sampled in 42 lakes of the Mastigouche Reserve, Que´ bec.",

The long-term ecological challenges associated with maintaining soil fertility in managed forests are not yet known, in part due to the complexity of soil microbial communities and the heterogeneity of forest soils. This study determined the long-term effects of timber harvesting, accompanied by varied organic matter (OM) removal, on bacterial and fungal soil populations in 11- to 17-year-old reforested coniferous plantations at 18 sites across North America. Analysis of highly replicated 16 S rRNA gene and ITS region pyrotag libraries and shotgun metagenomes demonstrated consistent changes in microbial communities in harvested plots that included the expansion of desiccation- and heat-tolerant organisms and decline in diversity of ectomycorrhizal fungi. However, the majority of taxa, including the most abundant and cosmopolitan groups, were unaffected by harvesting. Shifts in microbial populations that corresponded to increased temperature and soil dryness were moderated by OM retention, which also selected for sub-populations of fungal decomposers. Biogeographical differences in the distribution of taxa as well as local edaphic and environmental conditions produced substantial variation in the effects of harvesting. This extensive molecular-based investigation of forest soil advances our understanding of forest disturbance and lays the foundation for monitoring long-term impacts of timber harvesting.",

This study measured microbial community structure and function to assess the impacts of intensiﬁed biomass removal on soil from a managed northern jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.) forest in Ontario, Canada. Four clear-cut harvesting removal intensities were compared with uncut controls and mature, ﬁre-regenerated forest reference plots: stem-only removal, full-tree biomass removal, full-tree biomass with stump removal, and full-tree biomass with stump removal and soil blading that eliminated all aboveground and much belowground organic matter. A nearby recently burned forest site, representing common natural disturbance in the region, was also studied. Within the ﬁrst two years after harvesting, there were signiﬁcant differences in community structure and degradation of various C compounds among all harvested and unharvested sites, but little difference in communities across the different harvest intensities. Communities within the ﬁre site were not comparable with those of harvested treatments, indicating that clear-cut logging may not initially produce an ecologically comparable disturbance with that of ﬁre, although this conclusion is based on only one ﬁre disturbance site. In the two years after harvesting, an important time for seedling establishment in managed forest systems, it appears that intensiﬁcation of harvesting does not further disrupt microbial community structure and functioning beyond impacts from current harvest practices.",

		"abstract": "UNITE (https://unite.ut.ee; Nilsson et al. 2018) is an international community of scientists and citizen scientists established in 2001. The ambition of UNITE is to develop: 1) datasets and tools for robust and reproducible molecular identification; 2) Persistent Identifiers based system for the communicating fungal species. Datasets of the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, form the basis for UNITE. The current version includes nearly 1 million public fungal ITS sequences. Datasets are curated and annotated by community members. During the past 15 years, they made more than 275 000 improvements. In the complete absence of Latin names for species, UNITE offers a unique system where species hypotheses (SH) are provided with Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs). The current version 8 of UNITE offers more than 800 000 DOI-based SHs. One such SH DOI page is shown in Fig. 1. These DOI identifiers are also incorporated into the taxonomic backbone, making communication of taxa seamless in both directions. DOI identifiers of species hypotheses are also used by GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility) in order to publish high-throughput sequencing taxon occurrence data in their data portal. ‡ § |,¶ # ¤ © Kõljalg U et al.

		"abstract": "Biodiversity metrics are critical for assessment and monitoring of ecosystems threatened by anthropogenic stressors. Existing sorting and identification methods are too expensive and labour-intensive to be scaled up to meet management needs. Alternately, a high-throughput DNA sequencing approach could be used to determine biodiversity metrics from bulk environmental samples collected as part of a large-scale biomonitoring program. Here we show that both morphological and DNA sequence-based analyses are suitable for recovery of individual taxonomic richness, estimation of proportional abundance, and calculation of biodiversity metrics using a set of 24 benthic samples collected in the Peace-Athabasca Delta region of Canada. The high-throughput sequencing approach was able to recover all metrics with a higher degree of taxonomic resolution than morphological analysis. The reduced cost and increased capacity of DNA sequence-based approaches will finally allow environmental monitoring programs to operate at the geographical and temporal scale required by industrial and regulatory end-users.",

		"abstract": "Conventional assessments of ecosystem sample composition are based on morphology-based or DNA barcode identification of individuals. Both approaches are costly and time-consuming, especially when applied to the large number of specimens and taxa commonly included in ecological investigations. Next-generation sequencing approaches can overcome the bottleneck of individual specimen isolation and identification by simultaneously sequencing specimens of all taxa in a bulk mixture. Here we apply multiple parallel amplification primers, multiple DNA barcode markers, 454-pyrosequencing, and Illumina MiSeq sequencing to the same sample to maximize recovery of the arthropod macrobiome and the bacterial and other microbial microbiome of a bulk arthropod sample. We validate this method with a complex sample containing 1,066 morphologically distinguishable arthropods from a tropical terrestrial ecosystem with high taxonomic diversity. Multiamplicon next-generation DNA barcoding was able to recover sequences corresponding to 91% of the distinguishable individuals in a bulk environmental sample, as well as many species present as undistinguishable tissue. 454-pyrosequencing was able to recover 10 more families of arthropods and 30 more species than did conventional Sanger sequencing of each individual specimen. The use of other loci (16S and 18S ribosomal DNA gene regions) also added the detection of species of microbes associated with these terrestrial arthropods. This method greatly decreases the time and money necessary to perform DNA-based comparisons of biodiversity among ecosystem samples. This methodology opens the door to much cheaper and increased capacity for ecological and evolutionary studies applicable to a wide range of socio-economic issues, as well as a basic understanding of how the world works.",

		"abstract": "Characterizing biodiversity in a habitat or in targeted taxonomically or socioeconomically important groups remains a challenge. Standard DNA-based biodiversity identification tools such as DNA barcoding coupled with high-throughput Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies are rapidly changing the landscape of biodiversity analysis by targeting various habitats and a wide array of organisms. However, effective use of these technological advances requires optimized protocols and benchmarking against traditional tools. Here we investigate the use of commonly used preservative ethanol as a non-destructive and inexpensive source of DNA for NGS biodiversity analysis of benthic macroinvertebrates. We used the preservative ethanol added to field collected organisms (live sorted bulk benthic samples) as a source of community DNA for NGS environmental barcoding. We directly compare this approach with a DNA barcode library generated using Sanger sequencing of all individuals separated from abenthic sample as well as with NGS environmental barcoding of DNA extracted from mixed/homogenized tissue specimens of the same benthic sample. We also evaluate a multiplex PCR strategy, as compared to commonly used single amplicon workflow, using three newly designed primer sets targeting a wide array of benthic macroinvertebrate taxa.",

		"abstract": "The aim of this study was to assess belowground occurrence, persistence and possible impact of the biocontrol agent Phlebiopsis gigantea (Fr.) Jülich on soil fungi. Sampling of soil and roots of Picea abies (L.) H. Karst. was carried out at 12 P. gigantea-treated and five nontreated control sites representing 1- to 60-month-old clear-cuts and thinned forest sites in Finland and Latvia. The 454-sequencing of ITS rRNA from fine roots, humus and mineral soil resulted in 8626 high-quality fungal sequences. Phlebiopsis gigantea represented 1.3% of all fungal sequences and was found in 14 treated and nontreated sites and in all three substrates. In different substrates, the relative abundance of P. gigantea at stump treatment sites either did not differ significantly or was significantly lower than in nontreated controls. No significant correlation was found between the time elapsed since the tree harvesting and/or application of the biocontrol and abundance of P. gigantea in different substrates. In conclusion, the results demonstrate that P. gigantea occasionally occurs belowground in forest ecosystems but that stump treatment with the biocontrol agent has little or no impact on occurrence and persistence of P. gigantea belowground, and consequently no significant impact on soil fungi.",

		"abstract": "Sequencing of ribosomal DNA clone libraries amplified from environmental DNA has revolutionized our understanding of microbial eukaryote diversity and ecology. The results of these analyses have shown that protist groups are far more genetically heterogeneous than their morphological diversity suggests. However, the clone library approach is labour-intensive, relatively expensive, and methodologically biased. Therefore, even the most intensive rDNA library analyses have recovered only small samples of much larger assemblages, indicating that global environments harbour a vast array of unexplored biodiversity. High-throughput parallel tag 454 sequencing offers an unprecedented scale of sampling for molecular detection of microbial diversity. Here, we report a 454 protocol for sampling and characterizing assemblages of eukaryote microbes. We use this approach to sequence two SSU rDNA diversity markers-the variable V4 and V9 regions-from 10 L of anoxic Norwegian fjord water. We identified 38 116 V4 and 15 156 V9 unique sequences. Both markers detect a wide range of taxonomic groups but in both cases the diversity detected was dominated by dinoflagellates and close relatives. Long-tailed rank abundance curves suggest that the 454 sequencing approach provides improved access to rare genotypes. Most tags detected represent genotypes not currently in GenBank, although many are similar to database sequences. We suggest that current understanding of the ecological complexity of protist communities, genetic diversity, and global species richness are severely limited by the sequence data hitherto available, and we discuss the biological significance of this high amplicon diversity.",

		"abstract": "The natural variation of multiple abiotic stresses in hyper-seasonal edaphic savanna provides a unique opportunity to study the rhizobacteriome community structure of plants adapted to climate change-like conditions in the humid tropics. In this study, we evaluated changes in soil, plant and rhizobacteriome community structure parameters across seasons (wet and dry) in two edaphic savannas (SV-1 and SV-5) using four dominant plant species. We then examined relationships between rhizobacteriome community structure and soil properties, plant biomass, and conventional and novel root traits. We further hypothesized that plants adapted to the Aripo Savanna had a core rhizobacteriome, which was specific to plant species and related to root foraging traits. Our results showed that cation exchange capacity (CEC) and the concentration of micronutrients (Fe, Cu and B) were the only soil factors that differed across savanna and season, respectively. Plant biomass traits were generally higher in the dry season, with a higher allocation to root growth in SV-5. Root traits were more plastic in SV-5, and network length-distribution was the only root trait which showed a consistent pattern of lower values in the dry season for three of the dominant plant species. Rhizobacterial community compositions were dominated by Proteobacteria and Acidobacteria, as well as WPS-2, which is dominant in extreme environments. We identified a shared core rhizobacteriome across plant species and savannas. Cation exchange capacity was a major driver of rhizobacterial community assemblies across savannas. Savanna-specific drivers of rhizobacterial community assemblies included CEC and Fe for SV-1, and CEC, TDS, NH4+, NO3−, Mn, K, and network length-distribution for SV-5. Plant factors on the microbiome were minimal, and host selectivity was mediated by the seasonal changes. We conclude that edaphoclimatic factors (soil and season) are the key determinants influencing rhizobacteriome community structure in multiple stressed-environments, which are ecologically similar to the Aripo Savanna.",

		"abstract": "Freshwater ecosystems are a major source of methane (CH4), contributing 0.65 Pg (in CO2 equivalents) yr−1 towards global carbon emissions and offsetting ~25% of the terrestrial carbon sink. Most freshwater CH4 emissions come from littoral sediments, where large quantities of plant material are decomposed. Climate change is predicted to shift plant community composition, and thus change the quality of inputs into detrital food webs, with the potential to affect CH4 production. Here we find that variation in phenol availability from decomposing organic matter underlies large differences in CH4 production in lake sediments. Production is at least 400-times higher from sediments composed of macrophyte litter compared to terrestrial sources because of inhibition of methanogenesis by phenol leachates. Our results now suggest that earth system models and carbon budgets should consider the effects of plant communities on sediment chemistry and ultimately CH4 emissions at a global scale.",

The analysis of PLFAs extracted from soils can provide information about the overall structure of terrestrial microbial communities. PLFA profiling has been extensively used in a range of ecosystems as a biological index of overall soil quality, and as a quantitative indicator of soil response to land management and other environmental stressors., The standard method presented here outlines four key steps: 1. lipid extraction from soil samples with a single-phase chloroform mixture, 2. fractionation using solid phase extraction columns to isolate phospholipids from other extracted lipids, 3. methanolysis of phospholipids to produce fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs), and 4. FAME analysis by capillary gas chromatography using a flame ionization detector (GC-FID). Two standards are used, including 1,2-dinonadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PC(19:0/19:0)) to assess the overall recovery of the extraction method, and methyl decanoate (MeC10:0) as an internal standard (ISTD) for the GC analysis.",

ISSN 1652-6880, ISBN 91-576-7080-3 The potential of microbial community fingerprinting methods to provide information about compost maturity in composting facilities was investigated. Studies in a pilot-scale reactor equipped with independent control of oxygen content and temperature showed that low oxygen contents or low temperature had no dramatic effects on overall development of microbial community structure, determined with the PLFA (phospholipid fatty acid) method, although the process was generally delayed. Analyses of PLFAs typical for Actinobacteria, however, revealed that these bacteria were favoured when the maximum temperature was 40ºC. Actinobacteria populations constituted almost 50% of the microbial community during later stages of the reactor experiments, when only relatively complex, recalcitrant compounds remained, suggesting that some Actinobacteria may be suitable as indicator organisms for mature compost. Studies in a full-scale composting system showed that Actinobacteria constituted a relatively low, but constant proportion at roughly 10% of the microbial community. Analyses of Actinobacteria species composition using PCRDGGE (denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis) targeting 16S rRNA genes demonstrated that members of Corynebacterium were present at early stages and that thermo-tolerant Actinobacteria, e.g. Thermobifida, Streptosporangium, Saccharomonospora and Saccharopolyspora, were found throughout the long thermophilic phase. During the stage of decreasing temperature, the community included both thermo-tolerant and mesophilic Actinobacteria. The ester-linked fatty acid (EL) method for describing microbial community structure was shown to provide information related to aspects of maturity, and is potentially a relatively simple and fast method of assessing compost maturity. Combination of signature lipid and nucleic acid-based analyses greatly expanded the specificity and scope for assessing microbial community composition in composts.",

		"abstract": "The effects of rhizodeposition on soil C and N availabilities lead to substantial changes of microbial community composition and processes in the rhizosphere of plants. Under heterogeneous light, photosynthates can be translocated or shared between exposed and shaded ramets by clonal integration. Clonal integration may enhance the rhizodeposition of the shaded ramets, which further influences nutrient recycling in their rhizosphere. To test the hypothesis, we conducted a pot experiment by the stoloniferous herb Glechoma longituba subjected to heterogeneous light. Microbial biomass and community composition in the rhizosphere of shaded offspring ramets, assessed by phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) analysis, were markedly altered by clonal integration. Clonal integration positively affected C, N availabilities, invertase and urease activities, N mineralization (Nmin) and nitrification rates (Nnitri) in the rhizosphere of shaded offspring ramets. However, an opposite pattern was also observed in phenoloxidase (POXase) and peroxidase (PODase) activities. Our results demonstrated that clonal integration facilitated N assimilation and uptake in the rhizosphere of shaded offspring ramets. The experiment provides insights into the mechanism of nutrient recycling mediated by clonal integration.",

		"abstract": "Soil microbial communities modulate soil organic matter (SOM) dynamics by catalyzing litter decomposition. However, our understanding of how litter-derived carbon (C) flows through the microbial portion of the soil food web is far from comprehensive. This information is necessary to facilitate reliable predictions of soil C cycling and sequestration in response to a changing environment such as land use change in the form of agricultural abandonment. To examine the flow of litter-derived C through the soil microbial food web and it’s response to land use change, we carried out an incubation experiment with soils from six fields; three recently abandoned and three long term abandoned fields. In these soils, the fate of 13C-labeled plant litter was followed by analyzing phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) over a period of 56 days. The litter-amended soils were sampled over time to measure 13CO2 and mineral N dynamics. Microbial 13C-incorporation patterns revealed a clear succession of microbial groups during litter decomposition. Fungi were first to incorporate 13C-label, followed by G− bacteria, G+ bacteria, actinomycetes and micro-fauna. The order in which various microbial groups responded to litter decomposition was similar across all the fields examined, with no clear distinction between recent and long-term abandoned soils. Although the microbial biomass was initially higher in long-term abandoned soils, the net amount of 13C-labeled litter that was incorporated by the soil microbial community was ultimately comparable between recent and long-term abandoned fields. In relative terms, this means there was a higher efficiency of litter-derived 13C-incorporation in recent abandoned soil microbial communities compared to long-term abandoned soils, most likely due to a net shift from SOM-derived C toward root-derived C input in the soil microbial food web following land-abandonment.",

		"abstract": "Fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) profiling for characterizing microbial community composition typically is conducted via phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) or ester-linked fatty acid methyl ester (EL-FAME) methods. As soil health assessments aim to be utilized across the nation and globe, the robust measurement and interpretation of microbial communities across a range of soils and environments will be necessary. This study compared PLFA and EL-FAME methods for detecting and interpreting profiles of microbial community composition in croplands across a wide geographic area using a total of 172 soil samples from 14 states representing a wide range of soil properties. Overall, PLFA and EL-FAME provided comparable biomarkers in terms of microbial community composition. The Spearman's Rank correlation test showed positive correlations (r = 0.37–0.71) between PLFA and EL-FAME methods for absolute abundance of total FAME and individual microbial groups including fungi (saprophytic fungi [SF], arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi [AMF], and general fungi [F]) and all bacterial groups (Gram positive [GMP], Gram negative [GMN], and Actinobacteria). In both methods, a common set of fatty acids were influential in differentiating samples. The main differences in biomarker abundances between the two methods were that fungal and Actinobacteria biomarkers (e.g., 16:1ω5c [AMF], 18:1ω9c [F], 18:3ω6c [F], and 10Me16:0 [Actinobacteria]) were more abundant or critical in EL-FAME profiling (large variation among soil samples and sensitive to soil properties), but bacterial biomarkers such as i15:0 (GMP), 16:1ω7c (GMN), 18:1ω7c (GMN), and cy19:0ω7c (GMN) were more dominant and responsive to soil properties in PLFA profiling. The practical advantages of EL-FAME are lower cost and simpler methodology. Although both methods produced similar microbial profile abundances for important microbial markers, PLFA was more sensitive to the wide range of soil chemical properties in this sample set including pH, clay content, soil organic matter, and active carbon.",

		"abstract": "Global biodiversity is threatened by the anthropogenic restructuring of animal communities, rewiring species interaction networks in real-time as individuals are extirpated or introduced. Conservation science and adaptive ecosystem management demand more rapid, quantitative, and non-invasive technologies for robustly capturing changing biodiversity and quantifying species interactions. Here we develop molecular ecological network analyses (MENA) as an ecosystem assessment tool to address these needs. To construct the ecological network, we used environmental DNA from feces to identify the plant and mammal diet of two carnivores: puma (Puma concolor) and bobcat (Lynx rufus); two omnivores: coyote (Canis latrans) and gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus); and two herbivores: black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus) and black-tailed jackrabbit (Lepus californicus) in a well-studied Californian reserve. To evaluate MENA as a comprehensive biodiversity tool, we applied our framework to identify the structure of the network, patterns of trophic interactions, key species, and to assess its utility in capturing the biodiversity of the area. The high dietary taxonomic resolution enabled the assessment of species diversity, niche breadth and overlap. The network analysis revealed a dense ecological network with a high diversity of weakly connected species and a community that is highly modular and non-nested. The significant prevalence of tri-trophic chain and exploitative competition patterns indicates (i) the removal or reintroduction of a top predator would trigger a trophic cascade within this community, directly affecting their prey and indirectly the plant communities, and (ii) the potential impact of indirect effects between two predators that consume the same prey. These results suggest that the recent resurgence of puma in the study area may impact the herbaceous and woody vegetation and the population size of other predators. This effect of fluctuating predator populations and plant communities could be predicted through MENA’s fine-scale assessment of the diet selection and the identified keystone species. Although just using a subset of species, MENA more rapidly, accurately, and effectively captured the broader biodiversity of the area in comparison to other methodologies. MENA reconstructed and unveiled the hidden complexity in trophic structure and interaction networks within the community, providing a promising toolkit for biodiversity and ecosystem management.",

The energy of activation (Ea) values for the hydrolysis of tebufenozide at pH 4, 7 and 10, calculated from the Arrhenius plots, were 83.50, 66.71 and 50.87 kJ/mol, respectively. Tebufenozide was stable in sterilized stream water in the dark (T1/2 = 734 d) but it degraded fairly rapidly in unsterilized stream water (T1/2 = 181 d). Sunlight photodegradation of the chemical was slower (T1/2 = 83.0 h) than the photolysis by ultraviolet radiations (T1/2 values at 254 and 365 nm were 9.92 and 27.6 h, respectively); nevertheless, it was still appreciable during the summer months at 46°31’ N latitude. The differences in degradation rates between the unsterilized and sterilized stream water and the degradation of the chemical in the sterile, distilled water in sunlight, suggests that microbial processes and photolysis are the two main degradative routes for tebufenozide in natural aquatic systems.",

		"abstract": "Tebufenozide (RH‐5992, MIMIC®) [N'‐f‐butyl‐N'‐(3,5‐dimethylbenzoyl)‐N‐(4‐ethyl‐benzoyl) hydrazine] has the potential for use in spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana Clem.) control in Canadian forestry. Its persistence and fate in different forestry components after its aerial application were investigated. An emulsion suspension of MIMIC (containing a tracer dye) was applied twice, each time at the rate of 70 g of active ingredient (Al)/ha over a mixed‐wood forest near Longlac, Ontario, Canada, during 1994. Droplet density (droplets/cm2) and volume median diameter were determined on spruce needles [Picea glauca (Moench) Voss] after the 1st application, and the values averaged to 3.8 and 60 μm respectively. Droplet density, volume median diameter and deposit density (g Al/ha) determined on collection units near the pond site, were higher for the 1st application than for the 2nd application. In contrast, the corresponding values for the stream site were lower for the 1st application than for the 2nd application. The highest concentration of tebufenozide (μg/g wet wt) in soil was 0.101 for the 1st application, which was slightly lower than the value (0.116) obtained for the 2nd application. The corresponding values in litter were higher, 0.118 and 0.144 respectively. The residues decreased gradually with time and persisted until the last sampling day (87 d post‐spray). The DT50 (time required for 50 % of the initial deposit to dissipate) values were 42.2 d for soil and 80.0 d for litter, indicating the potential for overwintering of tebufenozide residues in these two matrices. The highest concentrations (ng/g fresh wt) of the chemical in spruce needles 1 h after the 1st and 2nd applications were 1.68 and 3.01 respectively, and for spruce shoots (current year growth) 1.06 and 2.08 respectively. The residues in spruce shoots disappeared faster than those in needles, although the chemical persisted in both matrices up to 87 d post‐spray, indicating similar overwintering potential as seen in soil and litter. The DT50 values for the needles and shoots were 44.3 d and 18.4 d, respectively. Higher initial deposits (μg/g fresh wt, 5.18 for 1st application and 5.51 for the 2nd application) were found on balsam poplar (Populus balsamifera L.) leaves than on spruce needles. The DT50 value (58.7 d) was also higher. The stream site received very low deposits during the 1st spray. The maximum 1 h post‐spray concentrations (μg/L) in the stream (2nd application) and pond waters (1st and 2nd applications) were 1.32, 5.31 and 1.26 respectively. Concentrations decreased rapidly in both sites after spray, giving an average DT50 value of 1.6 d. The initial 1‐h concentrations (μg/g wet wt) of the chemical in stream and pond sediments were low and ranged from 0.005 to 0.010. No residues were found in the stream or pond sediments after 4 and 12 d post‐spray (2nd application), respectively. Although the residues were transient, the data indicated a tendency for the sediment to act as a sink by adsorbing the chemical from the surrounding waters. After the second application, stream moss (Drepanoclàdus) gradually accumulated the chemical from an initial low concentration (μg/g, wet wt) of 0.072 (stream) to a peak level of 0.232 at 3 d post‐spray. Similarly, concentrations in pond moss increased from 0.120 (at 1 h) to 0.210 on 1 d post‐spray, indicating that both stream and pond moss acted as efficient sinks for the chemical. Residues declined from peak levels to non‐detectable levels in the stream moss after 38 d post‐application; however, the material persisted at detectable levels (0.015 μg/g) in pond moss beyond the 87 d sampling period. The foliage of marsh marigold (Caltha palustris) acted as a good receptor for the spray droplets. The initial concentrations (μg/g wet wt) of tebufenozide in stream (2nd application) and pond (1st and 2nd applications) samples were 0.896, 4.147 and 1.896 respectively. The residue levels at both sites decreased with time and the DT50 values ranged from 2.0 to 3.9 d (average value of 2.7 d). No residues were found in marigold foliage after 24 d post‐application. Transient but quantifiable levels of the chemical in the range of 0.069 to 0.13 μg/g (wet wt) were found in marigold roots, showing tendencies of bioconcentration. However, the residues declined to below the quantification level within 4 d (stream) and 12 d (pond) after application. Results of the study showed that a consortia of environmental factors (physical, chemical and metabolic) exerted influence to reduce both the duration and concentrations of tebufenozide in the forestry matrices.",

		"abstract": "The development of more affordable high-throughput DNA sequencing technologies and powerful bioinformatics is making of shotgun metagenomics a common tool for effective characterization of microbiomes and robust functional genomics. A shotgun metagenomic approach was applied in the characterization of microbial communities associated with plasticized fabric materials exposed to a harsh tropical environment for 14 months. High-throughput sequencing of TruSeq paired-end libraries was conducted using a whole-genome shotgun (WGS) approach on an Illumina HiSeq2000 platform generating 100 bp reads. A multifaceted bioinformatics pipeline was developed and applied to conduct quality control and trimming of raw reads, microbial classification, assembly of multi-microbial genomes, binning of assembled contigs to individual genomes, and prediction of microbial genes and proteins. The bioinformatic analysis of the large 161 Gb sequence dataset generated 3,314,688 contigs and 120 microbial genomes. The raw metagenomic data and the detailed description of the bioinformatics pipeline applied in data analysis provide an important resource for the genomic characterization of microbial communities associated with biodegraded plastic fabric materials. The raw shotgun metagenomics sequence data of microbial communities on plastic fabric materials have been deposited in MG-RAST (https://www.mg-rast.org/) under accession numbers: mgm4794685.3–mgm4794690.3. The datasets and raw data presented here were associated with the main research work “Metagenomic characterization of microbial communities on plasticized fabric materials exposed to harsh tropical environments” (Radwan et al., 2020).",
